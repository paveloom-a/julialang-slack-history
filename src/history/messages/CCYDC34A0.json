We’ll also try to minimise disruption to existing Turing.jl users by maximising backward compatibility.\nWe anticipate it might still be a long way ahead before we can release Turing 1.0. Any help, comments feedbacks on improving the development and release of Turing are welcome! We also welcome community developers to join the Turing.jl team. Together, we aim to make Julia the go-to language for Bayesian inference and computation."}]}]}],"client_msg_id":"936126fd-fb92-4b66-a35b-b9e8ee041c28","edited":{"user":"UCRDHV7PB","ts":"1607986264.000000"},"reactions":[{"name":"heart","users":["UGD4K0Z25","U011PPW7K53","UTVH86LJ0","U7QLM6E2E","UF6T1632L","UC0SY9JFP","UH08DT0JU","U01A08JMUKT","U01BTNDCUBX","U011SGGQJCA","U018NKR9X70","UE98VNG4U","U680T6770","U6H9SJKCH"],"count":14},{"name":"juliaspinner","users":["U011PPW7K53","UGU761DU2","U018NKR9X70","U01A4SJJQDA","U680T6770","U6H9SJKCH"],"count":6},{"name":"turing","users":["U019X0KMT6Y","U01BTNDCUBX","U011PPW7K53","U018NKR9X70","U680T6770","U6H9SJKCH"],"count":6}]},{"client_msg_id":"756f0666-93a0-43d0-9d68-f8f86a345e3f","type":"message","text":"To everyone,\nWe will have an open meeting on *18.12.2020 at 3pm CET*.
