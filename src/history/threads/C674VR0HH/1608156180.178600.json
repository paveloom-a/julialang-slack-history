But the promise of this approach is a powerful, concise, and consistent syntax for all kinds of transformations. Fwiw, after using it for a bit I think this promise has been fulfilled. Now the API is unified for v1.0. I suspect that some conveniences will be added back for simple stuff like this, but even if not, I think the benefits of the new system are well worth it.","fallback":"JuliaLang: Easier way to split-apply-combine in DataFrames.jl","thumb_url":"https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business5/uploads/julialang/original/2X/1/12829a7ba92b924d4ce81099cbf99785bee9b405.png","ts":1607913827,"from_url":"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/easier-way-to-split-apply-combine-in-dataframes-jl/51779/5","thumb_width":408,"thumb_height":263,"service_icon":"https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business5/uploads/julialang/optimized/2X/6/6ca888e296f59ca2a599807f7d5edd489e3d1829_2_180x180.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/easier-way-to-split-apply-combine-in-dataframes-jl/51779/5"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"IA4TQ","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"See "},{"type":"link","url":"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/easier-way-to-split-apply-combine-in-dataframes-jl/51779/5"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1608156180.178600","parent_user_id":"U01ARRMLM7E","reactions":[{"name":"eyes","users":["U01ARRMLM7E"],"count":1}]},{"client_msg_id":"a74749ec-b37d-4b8f-8803-c25cb649056f","type":"message","text":"(Different function but same reasoning.)","user":"U67431ELR","ts":"1608156505.179900","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"5ICm","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"(Different function but same reasoning.)"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1608156180.178600","parent_user_id":"U01ARRMLM7E"},{"client_msg_id":"5c564602-b3f7-4e64-9381-5ecfeac213f5","type":"message","text":"So I was initially nonplussed by its removal, but I also found the new way better after some time (<https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl/issues/2253>)","user":"U6740K1SP","ts":"1608156527.180100","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"uabDc","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"So I was initially nonplussed by its removal, but I also found the new way better after some time ("},{"type":"link","url":"https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl/issues/2253"},{"type":"text","text":")"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1608156180.178600","parent_user_id":"U01ARRMLM7E","reactions":[{"name":"eyes","users":["U01ARRMLM7E"],"count":1}]},{"client_msg_id":"2b2cd489-fc31-4ad6-93af-c77ae81141fa","type":"message","text":"also, it lives on in DataFramesMeta","user":"UBF9YRB6H","ts":"1608159555.180600","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"xPf","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"also, it lives on in DataFramesMeta"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1608156180.178600","parent_user_id":"U01ARRMLM7E"},{"client_msg_id":"86cea264-84f1-4019-9df0-7437bc8cdd56","type":"message","text":"`@by(df, :g, y = f(:x))` still works and will continue to work, because people like it","user":"UBF9YRB6H","ts":"1608159587.180800","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"ZHxj","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"@by(df, :g, y = f(:x))","style":{"code":true}},{"type":"text","text":" still works and will continue to work, because people like it"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1608156180.178600","parent_user_id":"U01ARRMLM7E"},{"client_msg_id":"fd970d7d-4570-4a2a-a80a-8c6d45013a69","type":"message","text":"and DataFramesMeta has a much smaller API so its less work to maintain it","user":"UBF9YRB6H","ts":"1608159603.181000","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"vqYoT","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"and DataFramesMeta has a much smaller API so its less work to maintain it"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1608156180.178600","parent_user_id":"U01ARRMLM7E"},{"client_msg_id":"141a8955-ddeb-4a28-9f82-ad4df20b3494","type":"message","text":"The deprecation of `aggregate` is the most heartbreaking one for me…","user":"USTUBS9ED","ts":"1608161694.181300","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"Req","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"The deprecation of "},{"type":"text","text":"aggregate","style":{"code":true}},{"type":"text","text":" is the most heartbreaking one for me…"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1608156180.178600","parent_user_id":"U01ARRMLM7E"}]
