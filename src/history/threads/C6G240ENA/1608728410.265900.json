Anyone tested this with a post-1.0 release? What I don’t like is that going from LLVM IR back to C is like a “step backwards”. After all, LLVM is a compiler, and its IR is a representation that is closer to the final machine code than to C – at least I see it this way. Especially since in our case here, the IR was not produced from C code. So it’s like stopping one compiler in the middle of his work, going back to (anothe...","fallback":"JuliaLang: Bring Julia code to embedded hardware (ARM)","thumb_url":"https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business5/uploads/julialang/original/2X/1/12829a7ba92b924d4ce81099cbf99785bee9b405.png","ts":1548262789,"from_url":"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/bring-julia-code-to-embedded-hardware-arm/19979/3","thumb_width":408,"thumb_height":263,"service_icon":"https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business5/uploads/julialang/optimized/2X/6/6ca888e296f59ca2a599807f7d5edd489e3d1829_2_180x180.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/bring-julia-code-to-embedded-hardware-arm/19979/3"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"H5Pef","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"link","url":"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/bring-julia-code-to-embedded-hardware-arm/19979/3"},{"type":"text","text":"\nsee here for a recent discussion"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1608728410.265900","parent_user_id":"U01A38DLY8N"},{"client_msg_id":"938cd611-9734-4929-a31f-8fcbe05244dc","type":"message","text":"cool thanks!!","user":"U01A38DLY8N","ts":"1608743812.267500","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"hhL0","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"cool thanks!!"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1608728410.265900","parent_user_id":"U01A38DLY8N"},{"client_msg_id":"aee89f5b-947d-4070-a46a-f4f8aee213b5","type":"message","text":"seems pretty tough haha. i might end up going with the raspi option.","user":"U01A38DLY8N","ts":"1608744166.267700","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"3ue9m","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"seems pretty tough haha. i might end up going with the raspi option."}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1608728410.265900","parent_user_id":"U01A38DLY8N"}]
