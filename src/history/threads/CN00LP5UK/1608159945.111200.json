Then all materials were made available to participants a few days before the conference. The conference itself then was organized into 25 (?) minute slots; each slot had two talks assigned; the idea being that you watch the talk *before* and then the slot is basically a Q&amp;A session, with roughly half the time dedicated to each of the two talks (but the format meant that was flexibility if one talk generated more interest than the other). So it's kinda \"inverted classroom\" but applied to talks. As I said, I was skeptical and expected a lot of awkward silence, and chair persons having to come up with questions etc., but it turned out that people had tons of questions and the slots were actually too short because of that.","user":"U012FH66MFW","ts":"1608159945.111200","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"OtL","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"I participated in a really nice virtual conference not so long ago which had a format about which I was super skeptical beforehand but it turned out to be awesome: all speakers were asked to pre-record their talks (fitting in their allotted time) and upload them at the latest a some time before the conference (optionally including additional materials such as slides etc.).
