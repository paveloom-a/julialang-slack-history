Side-band electromagnetic radiation emissions are present in (and with the proper equipment, can be captured from) keyboards, computer displays, printers, and other electronic devices.\nIn 1985, Wim van Eck published the first unclassified technical analysis of the security risks of emanations from computer monitors. This paper caused some consternation in the security community, which had previously believed that such monitoring was a highly sophisticated attack available only to governments; van Eck successfully eavesdropped on a real system, at a range of hundreds of metres, using just $15 worth of equipment plus a television set.\nAs a consequence of this research, such emanations are sometimes called \"van Eck radiation\", and the eavesdropping technique van Eck phreaking. Government researchers were already aware of the danger, as Bell Labs had noted this vulnerability to secure teleprinter communications during World War II and was able to produce 75% of the plaintext being processed in a secure facility from a distance of 80 feet (24 metres). Additionally, the NSA published Tempest Fundamentals, NSA-82-89, NACSIM 5000, National Security Agency (Classified) on February 1, 1982. Also, the van Eck technique was successfully demonstrated to non-TEMPEST personnel in Korea during the Korean War in the 1950s.\nWhile Phreaking is the process of exploiting telephone networks, it is used here because of its connection to eavesdropping. Van Eck phreaking of CRT displays is the process of eavesdropping on the contents of a CRT by detecting its electromagnetic emissions.","fallback":"wikipedia: Van Eck phreaking","service_icon":"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/unfurl_icons/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Eck_phreaking"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"e6F","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"reminds me of "},{"type":"link","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Eck_phreaking"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1608222373.320900","parent_user_id":"U6QGE7S86"},{"client_msg_id":"34b230bc-b643-4542-9ef5-731238814aec","type":"message","text":"which totally blew my mind when I first learned about it","user":"U6795JH6H","ts":"1608240606.333700","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"7Zvx","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"which totally blew my mind when I first learned about it"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1608222373.320900","parent_user_id":"U6QGE7S86"},{"client_msg_id":"e8999292-e6c0-43c8-89d9-5d2fb0221531","type":"message","text":"It's the reason some of the computer equipment we used in the military was so heavy: additional lead to keep the radiation from being spied upon.... 3 people were required to lift the CRT monitors.

It can be used to eavesdrop with minimal chance of exposure.\nThe object is typically inside a room where a conversation is taking place and can be anything that can vibrate (for example, a picture on a wall) in response to the pressure waves created by noises present in the room. The object preferably should have a smooth surface for the beam to be reflected accurately. The laser beam is directed into the room through a window, reflects off the object, and returns to a receiver that converts the beam to an audio signal. The beam may also be bounced off the window itself. The minute differences in the distance traveled by the light as it reflects from the vibrating object are detected interferometrically. The interferometer converts the variations to intensity variations, and electronics are used to convert these variations to signals that can be converted back to sound.","fallback":"wikipedia: Laser microphone","service_icon":"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/unfurl_icons/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_microphone"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"H=nBV","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"link","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_microphone"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1608222373.320900","parent_user_id":"U6QGE7S86"}]
