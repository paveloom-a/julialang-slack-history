But it tastes really good. I drink coffee black so I like it kinda of thick and bitter, macha gives me more of that. Except macha isn't bitter at all, a little acidic/irony, but in a good way. Supposedly it's healthier than tea too - I'm a little skeptical of that but I like it.\n\nMy favorite tea is probably jasmine green tea. So hard to find good loose leaf though.
