I am the main developer of the Rocket.jl package. Indeed what you want in theory should be possible with our package, but schedulers section is still undocumented (we are working on it) and there is no “predetermined scheduler”. You will probably need to write your own “test-sheduler” implementation and use `|&gt; schedule_on(scheduler)` operator (which is also undocumented yet). You can check how we write different schedulers in `src/schedulers`  folder and in `src/scheduler.jl`  there is a list of functions you will need to implement for your custom scheduler.","user":"UPLCGPTS6","ts":"1608205029.017100","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"=WaE","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hey "},{"type":"user","user_id":"UDSG73JTH"},{"type":"text","text":"!
