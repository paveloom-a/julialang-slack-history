Then I spent quite some time to try figuring out whether any of these languages is a better choice for deep learning than Python. However, soon I realized that Chris Lattner left Google and Swift for Tensorflow project is slowing down and even Jeremy Howard is less passionate about it. Then the only choice left for now is Julia AFAIK. The Question is whether Julia is ready for deep learning.","fallback":"Yangzai’s Blog: Is Julia Ready for Deep Learning","ts":1605058098,"from_url":"https://sychen52.github.io/2020/11/11/IsJuliaReadyForDeepLearning.html","id":1,"original_url":"https://sychen52.github.io/2020/11/11/IsJuliaReadyForDeepLearning.html"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"Vc0","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"link","url":"https://sychen52.github.io/2020/11/11/IsJuliaReadyForDeepLearning.html"}]}]}]},{"client_msg_id":"cd0f1e65-242b-41d1-9b4b-82cf8f5492d9","type":"message","text":"I think I am hitting a Zygote 0.5 bug.
