Quick question on solving a system of inequalities, I might be making a mistake either in the math or in Julia.\n\nI need to get a function that solves a system of linear inequalities given a function `v`. The function `v` maps `2^{1, 2, 3} -&gt; |R`. The system has then three variables, say `x1, x2, x3`. The inequalities are always,\n\n```x1 ≥ v({1}),   x1 + x2 ≥ v({1, 2})\nx2 ≥ v({2}),   x1 + x3 ≥ v({1, 3})\nx3 ≥ v({3}),   x2 + x3 ≥ v({2, 3})```\nInspired by <http://discourse.julialang.org/t/solving-a-linear-system-of-equalities-and-inequalities|discourse.julialang.org/t/solving-a-linear-system-of-equalities-and-inequalities> I am trying to use the polyhedron function of `LazySets`, as follows,\n\n```using LazySets, Polyhedra\n\nA = [\n    1 0 0;\n    0 1 0;\n    0 0 1;\n    1 1 0;\n    1 0 1;\n    0 1 1;\n    1 1 1\n]\n\nb = [v(1), v(2), v(3), v([1, 2]), v([1, 3]), v([2, 3]), v(N)]\np = polyhedron(Polyhedra.hrep(A, b))```\nbut the system seems to big for the function to handle or maybe I am mistyping something. Do you guys have any idea how to solve this or is there a better way to solve this problem?","user":"U01FPHR7WKB","ts":"1610458106.142400","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"9j7","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hello everyone!
