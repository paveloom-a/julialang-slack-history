I am trying out some Luxor.jl code to create animations. This one, for instance:\n```# Adapted from [Cormullian's Slackmojiv's post](<https://cormullion.github.io/pages/2019-06-23-slackmojif/>)\nusing Luxor\n\nfunction frame(scene, framenumber)\n    nfn = rescale(framenumber, scene.framerange.start, scene.framerange.stop)\n    rotate(π*sin(nfn * 2π))\n    juliacircles(18)\nend\n\nsize = 64\nmymovie = Movie(size, size, \"mymovie\")\nanimate(mymovie, [Scene(mymovie, frame, 1:60)],\n    creategif=true, pathname=\"juliafullrocker$(size)x$(size).gif\")```\nIn the REPL, there is no problem, and the animated gif is created. But when I run it from inside vscode, I get the error\n```┌ Info: Frames for animation \"mymovie\" are being stored in directory: \n└        /var/folders/yj/2q95f5rd57n7_6_q2jym158w0000gn/T/jl_zbLIzB\n┌ Warning: Movie framerange is longer than scene frame range: \n│        1:250 &gt; 60\n└ @ Luxor ~/.julia/packages/Luxor/XSNgj/src/animate.jl:185\n┌ Info: ... 60 frames saved in directory:\n└        /var/folders/yj/2q95f5rd57n7_6_q2jym158w0000gn/T/jl_zbLIzB\nERROR: LoadError: IOError: could not spawn `ffmpeg -loglevel panic -framerate 30 -f image2 -i /var/folders/yj/2q95f5rd57n7_6_q2jym158w0000gn/T/jl_zbLIzB/%10d.png -filter_complex '[0:v] split [a][b]; [a] palettegen=stats_mode=full:reserve_transparent=on:transparency_color=FFFFFF [p]; [b][p] paletteuse=new=1:alpha_threshold=128' -y /var/folders/yj/2q95f5rd57n7_6_q2jym158w0000gn/T/jl_zbLIzB/mymovie.gif`: no such file or directory (ENOENT)\nStacktrace:\n [1] _spawn_primitive(::String, ::Cmd, ::Array{Any,1}) at ./process.jl:99\n [2] #585 at ./process.jl:112 [inlined]\n [3] setup_stdios(::Base.var\"#585#586\"{Cmd}, ::Array{Any,1}) at ./process.jl:196\n [4] _spawn at ./process.jl:111 [inlined]\n [5] run(::Cmd; wait::Bool) at ./process.jl:439\n [6] run at ./process.jl:438 [inlined]\n [7] animate(::Movie, ::Array{Scene,1}; creategif::Bool, framerate::Int64, pathname::String, tempdirectory::String, usenewffmpeg::Bool) at /Users/rrosa/.julia/packages/Luxor/XSNgj/src/animate.jl:211\n [8] top-level scope at /Users/rrosa/Documents/git_repositories/julia/julia_random_stuff/src/julia_rocker.jl:16\nin expression starting at /Users/rrosa/Documents/git_repositories/julia/julia_random_stuff/src/julia_rocker.jl:16```\nWhen I copy the ffmpeg command and run it directly in the shell, it works too.\n\nIs that due to how the VSCode Julia extension handles this or is it something else?","user":"U01CR62LAAD","ts":"1614547658.076700","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"k9iRS","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"I am getting an error that only happens in the REPL spawned by VSCode, not in the usual REPL.
