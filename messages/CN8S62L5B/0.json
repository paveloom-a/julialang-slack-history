Unlike traditional cryptographic tasks, where cryptography assures security and integrity of communication or storage and the adversary is outside the system of participants (an eavesdropper on the sender and receiver), the cryptography in this model protects participants' privacy from each other. \nThe foundation for secure multi-party computation started in the late 1970s with the work on mental poker, cryptographic work that simulates game playing/computational tasks over distances without requiring a trusted third party. Note that traditionally, cryptography was about concealing content, while this new type of computation and protocol is about concealing partial information about data while computing with the data from many sources, and correctly producing outputs.","fallback":"wikipedia: Secure multi-party computation","service_icon":"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/unfurl_icons/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"C7Ga","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"This channel is too quiet "},{"type":"emoji","name":"slightly_smiling_face"},{"type":"text","text":" Question: does anyone know about any multi-party computation (MPC) package in Julia?
