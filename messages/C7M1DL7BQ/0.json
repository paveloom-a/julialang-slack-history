And one of the goals is to stay as true as possible to the original input, output and gameplay? I’d say that this calls for an official test harness. Given that these are terminal games it should be possible to hook stdin and stdout up to a game runner. The verification could be generated by actually playing the original game. Just an idea.","fallback":"Coding Horror Discussion: Updating \"101 Basic Computer Games\" for 2021","thumb_url":"https://discourse-cdn.codinghorror.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/d/cdd36aa719170a8a6c091f66577566ab6c41c4a3_2_1024x680.jpeg","ts":1614540340,"from_url":"https://discourse.codinghorror.com/t/updating-101-basic-computer-games-for-2021/7927/45","thumb_width":1024,"thumb_height":680,"service_icon":"https://discourse-cdn.codinghorror.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/f/3/f3dfe83738183d904a8b8885e58bc97c4ec22301_2_180x180.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://discourse.codinghorror.com/t/updating-101-basic-computer-games-for-2021/7927/45"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"Gns","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"link","url":"https://discourse.codinghorror.com/t/updating-101-basic-computer-games-for-2021/7927/45"}]}]}]},{"client_msg_id":"48247d71-2587-4b48-b2d9-495bf03aa37e","type":"message","text":"We’re looking for a private tutor proficient in Julia, AWS, and GCP (if interested, apply here) : <https://www.indeed.com/job/online-tutor-certified-google-cloudaws-machine-learning-cbcf5f66b4168faf|Online Tutor Certified in Google Cloud+AWS Machine Learning - Remote - ><http://Indeed.com|Indeed.com>","user":"U010SDWT1EV","ts":"1617653644.001100","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"0hx","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"We’re looking for a private tutor proficient in Julia, AWS, and GCP (if interested, apply here) : "},{"type":"link","url":"https://www.indeed.com/job/online-tutor-certified-google-cloudaws-machine-learning-cbcf5f66b4168faf","text":"Online Tutor Certified in Google Cloud+AWS Machine Learning - Remote - "},{"type":"link","url":"http://Indeed.com","text":"Indeed.com"}]}]}]}]}
