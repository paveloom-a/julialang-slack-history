And one of the goals is to stay as true as possible to the original input, output and gameplay? Iâ€™d say that this calls for an official test harness. Given that these are terminal games it should be possible to hook stdin and stdout up to a game runner. The verification could be generated by actually playing the original game. Just an idea.","fallback":"Coding Horror Discussion: Updating \"101 Basic Computer Games\" for 2021","thumb_url":"https://discourse-cdn.codinghorror.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/c/d/cdd36aa719170a8a6c091f66577566ab6c41c4a3_2_1024x680.jpeg","ts":1614540340,"from_url":"https://discourse.codinghorror.com/t/updating-101-basic-computer-games-for-2021/7927/45","thumb_width":1024,"thumb_height":680,"service_icon":"https://discourse-cdn.codinghorror.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/f/3/f3dfe83738183d904a8b8885e58bc97c4ec22301_2_180x180.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://discourse.codinghorror.com/t/updating-101-basic-computer-games-for-2021/7927/45"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"Gns","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"link","url":"https://discourse.codinghorror.com/t/updating-101-basic-computer-games-for-2021/7927/45"}]}]}]}]}
