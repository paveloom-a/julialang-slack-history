After some frustration with auto-complete options available in `nvim` and many of them not playing nicely with latex-to-unicode, I have implemented [a latex source](<https://gitlab.com/ExpandingMan/compe-latex>) for the [`nvim-compe`](<https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-compe>) auto-completion plugin.  The advantage of this is that it allows you to use `compe` with any possible latex completion appearing in the popup.\n\nThere's still at least one major loose edge: I cannot yet find an elegant way of getting `compe` to enter latex as you type, so right now I am *also* using the LaTeX-to-unicode from `julia-vim`.  As far as I can tell there is no issue with using both.","files":[{"id":"F01SDFGJQG5","created":1616713830,"timestamp":1616713830,"name":"compe-latex-preview.gif","title":"compe-latex-preview.gif","mimetype":"image/gif","filetype":"gif","pretty_type":"GIF","user":"U9VG1AYSG","editable":false,"size":269278,"mode":"hosted","is_external":false,"external_type":"","is_public":true,"public_url_shared":false,"display_as_bot":false,"username":"","url_private":"https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T68168MUP-F01SDFGJQG5/compe-latex-preview.gif","url_private_download":"https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T68168MUP-F01SDFGJQG5/download/compe-latex-preview.gif","thumb_64":"https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T68168MUP-F01SDFGJQG5-6498ad17e1/compe-latex-preview_64.png","thumb_80":"https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T68168MUP-F01SDFGJQG5-6498ad17e1/compe-latex-preview_80.png","thumb_360":"https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T68168MUP-F01SDFGJQG5-6498ad17e1/compe-latex-preview_360.png","thumb_360_w":360,"thumb_360_h":267,"thumb_480":"https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T68168MUP-F01SDFGJQG5-6498ad17e1/compe-latex-preview_480.png","thumb_480_w":480,"thumb_480_h":356,"thumb_160":"https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T68168MUP-F01SDFGJQG5-6498ad17e1/compe-latex-preview_160.png","thumb_720":"https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T68168MUP-F01SDFGJQG5-6498ad17e1/compe-latex-preview_720.png","thumb_720_w":720,"thumb_720_h":534,"thumb_800":"https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T68168MUP-F01SDFGJQG5-6498ad17e1/compe-latex-preview_800.png","thumb_800_w":800,"thumb_800_h":594,"thumb_960":"https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T68168MUP-F01SDFGJQG5-6498ad17e1/compe-latex-preview_960.png","thumb_960_w":960,"thumb_960_h":712,"thumb_1024":"https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T68168MUP-F01SDFGJQG5-6498ad17e1/compe-latex-preview_1024.png","thumb_1024_w":1024,"thumb_1024_h":760,"thumb_360_gif":"https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T68168MUP-F01SDFGJQG5-6498ad17e1/compe-latex-preview_360.gif","thumb_480_gif":"https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T68168MUP-F01SDFGJQG5-6498ad17e1/compe-latex-preview_480.gif","original_w":1055,"original_h":783,"deanimate":"https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T68168MUP-F01SDFGJQG5-6498ad17e1/compe-latex-preview_deanimate.png","deanimate_gif":"https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T68168MUP-F01SDFGJQG5-6498ad17e1/compe-latex-preview_deanimate_gif.png","thumb_tiny":"AwAjADClRRRTAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKACiiigD/9k=","permalink":"https://julialang.slack.com/files/U9VG1AYSG/F01SDFGJQG5/compe-latex-preview.gif","permalink_public":"https://slack-files.com/T68168MUP-F01SDFGJQG5-7ccec56394","is_starred":false,"has_rich_preview":false}],"upload":false,"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"ZT8w","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hello all.
