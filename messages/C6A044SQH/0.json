New to Julia, long-time R user. I am looking for the equivalent of R's approxfun in Julia and its use in ODE systems (as in here: "},{"type":"link","url":"https://tpetzoldt.github.io/deSolve-forcing/deSolve-forcing.html#example_1:_time-varying_input"},{"type":"text","text":"). Is there a simple code example/tutorial available online for when you have an ODE with a time-varying input modelled with an approx function? TIA"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1614346949.482300","reply_count":2,"reply_users_count":1,"latest_reply":"1614347062.483200","reply_users":["B01J9QZ4SP8"],"subscribed":false},{"type":"message","subtype":"tombstone","text":"This message was deleted.","user":"USLACKBOT","hidden":true,"ts":"1614353907.489000","thread_ts":"1614353907.489000","reply_count":1,"reply_users_count":1,"latest_reply":"1614353909.489100","reply_users":["B01J9QZ4SP8"],"subscribed":false},{"client_msg_id":"0258a615-bf0b-4568-9f2b-b0dd484e1627","type":"message","text":"Could the HelpDeskBot be replaced by a more informative channel topic?

I am looking at the source of <https://github.com/chakravala/Fatou.jl/blob/master/src/Fatou.jl|Fatou.jl> to understand how their implementation of the Mandelbrot visualization is faster. I have a couple of questions:\n1. The `n` variable they have used is for horizontal grid points. Is that the same as the num of pixels/coordinates calculated? So it calculates for 176x176 pixels by default?\n2. It's `N` is UInt8, and it means the maximum iteration per coordinate (or complex coordinate) is just 255. I've read that you would need atleast a value of 1000 for max iteration for the visualization to be quite accurate. Is this actually restricted to 255 or am I just confusing `N` with max iteration?\n3. Does anyone have a fast Mandelbrot visualization in Julia (without using GPU) which runs well for 1920x1080 images?","user":"U01PP5BA1C4","ts":"1614356953.498600","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"d+3r","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hi.
