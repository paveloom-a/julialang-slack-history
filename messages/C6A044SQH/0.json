In my current implementation (see below) I use indicators rootnode and leafnode to indicate where the tree ends. In this case A11, A22 usually remain uninitialized and are #undef objects. I want to have the option of not having to specify certain fields of my data structures as they only make sense in a certain context (if it is a leafnode for instance). What is the best way to do that?\n"}]},{"type":"rich_text_preformatted","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"mutable struct HssMatrix{T<:Number} <: AbstractMatrix{T}\n  # 2x2 recursive block structure for branchnodes\n  A11       ::HssMatrix{T}\n  A22       ::HssMatrix{T}\n  B12       ::Matrix{T}\n  B21       ::Matrix{T}\n\n  # indicators whether we are at the root- or leafnode\n  rootnode  ::Bool\n  leafnode  ::Bool\n\n  # dimensions of its children\n  m1        ::Integer\n  n1        ::Integer\n  m2        ::Integer\n  n2        ::Integer\n\n  # translation operators if we are at a branchnode\n  R1        ::Matrix{T}\n  R2        ::Matrix{T}\n  W1        ::Matrix{T}\n  W2        ::Matrix{T}\n\n  # at the leaf level we store the diagonal block and generators directly\n  U         ::Matrix{T}\n  V         ::Matrix{T}\n  D         ::Matrix{T}\n\n  # inner constructor\n  HssMatrix{T}() where T = new{T}()\n  HssMatrix() = HssMatrix{Float64}()\nend"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1611743574.414500","reply_count":7,"reply_users_count":2,"latest_reply":"1611769027.435900","reply_users":["U7HAYKY9X","U01L0RJC6FM"],"subscribed":false},{"client_msg_id":"007c8474-1db2-48f0-9f3e-d89c988a65d0","type":"message","text":"Currently I keep them as #undef but I run into many situations where I have to work around the way Julia handles #undef fields.","user":"U01L0RJC6FM","ts":"1611743608.415200","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"UnOoZ","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Currently I keep them as #undef but I run into many situations where I have to work around the way Julia handles #undef fields."}]}]}]},{"client_msg_id":"f5aa4973-4844-4b08-aa4e-2416a9452a58","type":"message","text":"I just realised I should have posted to general perhaps.
