You will work closely with our device fabrication team to enable and optimize the manufacturing of quantum devices. You will also work cross-functionally with our design and measurement teams to ensure they have access to the fabrication data they need.Potential projects may include:· Working with fabrication engineers to improve component level yield· Performing data analysis to analyze device fabrication records for quality and yield improvement· Building and working with fabrication record database software· Building and maintaining interfaces to the databases to enable quick storage, retrieval and processing of fab measurements· Setting up and maintaining a monitoring system for fab tools, which includes a number of continuously operating, distributed, IoT like sensorsOn the AWS CQC software team we value people with a genuine curiosity towards new technologies. Prior experience working in the fabrication industry is required, but experience working with quantum device fabrication is not required.Work/Life BalanceAt the AWS CQC, we understand that developing quantum computing technology is a marathon, not a sprint. Mental and physical wellness is encouraged within our team and throughout AWS. The work/life integration within Amazon encourages a culture where employees work hard and have ownership over their downtime. We are exploring more structured wellness elements including meditation scheduling, running group meet-ups, and a culture of sharing wellness tips.Mentorship and Career GrowthWe are committed to the growth and development of every member of the Center for Quantum Computing. You will receive career-growth-minded management and mentorship from a software and science team and also have the opportunity to participate in Amazon's mentorship programs. You will work closely with quantum research scientists and have opportunities to learn about quantum computing technology and contribute to the development of scientific software for quantum computing at AWS.Inclusive and Diverse CultureThe AWS CQC is intentional about attracting, developing, and retaining amazing talent from diverse backgrounds to build a world class team. We’re looking for a new teammate who is enthusiastic, empathetic, curious, motivated, reliable, and able to work effectively with their peers. With quantum computing being a new and growing initiative within AWS, you would have an opportunity to make an impact on our budding team culture.","fallback":"amazon.jobs: Quantum Software Engineer - Device Fabrication","image_url":"https://static.amazon.jobs/global_images/2/images/Jobs_thumbnailV2.jpg?1554491962","from_url":"https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1418408/quantum-software-engineer-device-fabrication","image_width":476,"image_height":250,"image_bytes":49619,"service_icon":"http://static.amazon.jobs/assets/favicon-17d02e2db6dbedb95dd449d06868c147ac2c3b5371497bcb9407e75336a99e09.ico","id":1,"original_url":"https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1418408/quantum-software-engineer-device-fabrication"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"hPqm","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"link","url":"https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1418408/quantum-software-engineer-device-fabrication","text":"https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1418408/quantum-software-engineer-device-fabrication"}]}]}]},{"client_msg_id":"6a630fe0-8e0d-42d6-8a51-735ae28f39f3","type":"message","text":"Ad doesn't mention Julia but it's used in other parts of the organization, wanted to share here in case anyone is interested.
