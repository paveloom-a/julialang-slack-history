I often think that I should write everything for `Vector{UInt8}` because of this, but this will assume I can always read in the entire buffer I need first, and indeed in the rare cases when it just can't work this way things can get rather tricky.  Other times, an `IO` actually turns out to be more convenient (particularly because of the `read(io, T)` methods).  Is there some way permanently out of this dilemma of choice?  Am I being ridiculous to worry about the time it takes to allocate an `IO` in IO contexts?
