Given the function:\n```@inline function num_unique(group_str::AbstractString)\n    return group_str |&gt; Set |&gt; length\nend```\nI have defined a super function (with two variants and their output and lowered code). Variant 1:\n```function sum_unique(group_strs::Vector{&lt;:AbstractString})\n    # clump groups to one line before adding to set (removes the need for union)\n    f = x -&gt; replace(x, \"\\n\" =&gt; \"\")\n    return group_strs .|&gt; f .|&gt; num_unique |&gt; sum\nend```\nOutput of variant 1:\n```sum_unique(group_strs) = 6703```\nLowered code of variant 1:\n```@code_lowered sum_unique([\"abaz\\nasd\", \"ashds\\ndshgs\"])\nCodeInfo(\n1 ─      #23 = %new(Main.:(var\"#23#24\"))\n│        f = #23\n│   %3 = Base.broadcasted(Main.:|&gt;, group_strs, f)\n│   %4 = Base.broadcasted(Main.:|&gt;, %3, Main.num_unique)\n│   %5 = Base.materialize(%4)\n│   %6 = %5 |&gt; Main.sum\n└──      return %6\n)```\nNow the okay-looking (to me) variant 2:\n```function sum_unique(group_strs::Vector{&lt;:AbstractString})\n    # clump groups to one line before adding to set (removes the need for union)\n    return group_strs .|&gt; x -&gt; replace(x, \"\\n\" =&gt; \"\") .|&gt; num_unique |&gt; sum\nend```\nOutput of variant 2:\n```sum_unique(group_strs) = [3, 16, 22, 22, ...] # sum(output array) = 6703```\nLowered code of variant 2:\n```@code_lowered sum_unique2([\"abaz\\nasd\", \"ashds\\ndshgs\"])\nCodeInfo(\n1 ─      #27 = %new(Main.:(var\"#27#28\"))\n│   %2 = #27\n│   %3 = Base.broadcasted(Main.:|&gt;, group_strs, %2)\n│   %4 = Base.materialize(%3)\n└──      return %4 # doesn't even call sum and just exits!\n)```\nI am not sure why this is happening. What is wrong with chaining after an anonymous function?","author_name":"Pranshu Malik","author_link":"https://julialang.slack.com/team/U01BX0V74Q2","author_icon":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2020-10-03/1411221321028_a3d4ae365ae9f32ec405_48.jpg","mrkdwn_in":["text"],"id":1,"original_url":"https://julialang.slack.com/archives/C6A044SQH/p1607992899130500","footer":"Thread in #helpdesk"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"MLlL","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hi all, I opened an issue for "},{"type":"link","url":"https://julialang.slack.com/archives/C6A044SQH/p1607992899130500","text":"this problem"},{"type":"text","text":" here: "},{"type":"link","url":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/38884"},{"type":"text","text":".
