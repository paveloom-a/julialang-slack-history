I look at the literature about adapted mesh for BVP, it is a mess (to sum up). I Dont know what you had in mind for the code. Your code reference “A Runge-Kutta Type Boundary Value ODE Solver with Defect Control” but there is no adaptation. Something really good is “Hale, Nicholas. “A Sixth-Order Extension to the MATLAB Package Bvp4c of J. Kierzenka and L. Shampine,” n.d., 17.” but it is “old” now.  Another issue for me is that this paper is about MIRK6 which has more filling obviously than MIRK4 for large scale problem. To me, I think the best around for midly stiff is “Cash, J. R., and F. Mazzia. “A New Mesh Selection Algorithm, Based on Conditioning, for Two-Point Boundary Value Codes.” _Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics_ 184, no. 2 (December 15, 2005): 362–81. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2005.01.016>.” But this mesh adaptation is tricky to say the least.
