However, they are typically irrelevant for the description of symmetry-broken states. Here, the authors propose a variant of the spin-fermion model, which exhibits a novel thermodynamically stable phase dubbed the ``Instanton Crystal.'' The intriguing feature of this phase is the configuration of the order parameter consisting precisely of an alternating chain of instantons and anti-instantons. Another interesting feature is a first-order phase transition between the instanton crystal phase and the normal symmetry-broken phase, characterized by a stationary order parameter.","fallback":"Physical Review B: Phase transition into an instanton crystal state","thumb_url":"https://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRB/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevB.103.075121.png","ts":1612857600,"from_url":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.103.075121","thumb_width":200,"thumb_height":200,"id":1,"original_url":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.103.075121"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"TbiJ","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Any APS memebers who can send me "},{"type":"link","url":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.103.075121"},{"type":"text","text":" ?

We find that 24.8% experience moderate or severe symptoms of depression or anxiety&amp;mdash;more than two times the population average. Though our response rate was 45.1% and sample selection concerns exist, conservative lower bounds nonetheless suggest higher prevalence rates of such symptoms than in the general population. Mental health issues are especially prevalent at the end of the PhD program: 36.7% of students in years 6+ of their program experience moderate or severe symptoms of depression or anxiety, versus 21.2% of first-year students. 25.2% of economics students with these symptoms are in treatment, compared to 41.4% of graduate students in other programs. A similar percentage of economics students (40-50%) say they cannot honestly discuss mental health with advisers as say they cannot honestly discuss research progress or non-academic career options. Only 26% find their work to be useful always or most of the time, compared to 70% of economics faculty and 63% of the working age population. We provide recommendations for students, faculty, and administrators on ways to improve graduate student mental health.","fallback":"Graduate Student Mental Health: Lessons from American Economics Departments","thumb_url":"https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/images/jel","from_url":"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20201555&from=f","thumb_width":625,"thumb_height":625,"service_icon":"https://www.aeaweb.org/favicon.ico","service_name":"aeaweb.org","id":1,"original_url":"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20201555&amp;from=f"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"ubSND","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"This is real sad "},{"type":"link","url":"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20201555&from=f"}]}]}]},{"client_msg_id":"76b7d7dc-3478-4a6c-82d7-e6c9fb52279a","type":"message","text":"Resumes for a Phd grad applying to industry: include publications or nah?","user":"U011V2YN59N","ts":"1616095249.001100","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"dVln9","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Resumes for a Phd grad applying to industry: include publications or nah?"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1616095249.001100","reply_count":3,"reply_users_count":1,"latest_reply":"1616095326.002100","reply_users":["U66M57AN4"],"subscribed":false},{"client_msg_id":"c8d05e78-d428-4fad-8ef4-e6a9bacceb8a","type":"message","text":"yes","user":"U674T3KB3","ts":"1616095281.001300","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"Kn9","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"yes"}]}]}],"reactions":[{"name":"+1","users":["U011V2YN59N","UGU761DU2"],"count":2}]},{"client_msg_id":"a2d61749-0dd5-4d14-9301-671a44f74379","type":"message","text":"Be prepared to answer questions about anything you list though - I've seen people get in trouble for listing publications where they helped out with the research over their summers, but didn't really know much about it","user":"U674T3KB3","ts":"1616095377.003400","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"ddv","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Be prepared to answer questions about anything you list though - I've seen people get in trouble for listing publications where they helped out with the research over their summers, but didn't really know much about it"}]}]}],"reactions":[{"name":"+1::skin-tone-5","users":["U6QGE7S86"],"count":1},{"name":"+1","users":["U011V2YN59N"],"count":1},{"name":"this-is-true","users":["UGU761DU2"],"count":1}]},{"client_msg_id":"93eac98b-3a5c-4535-8b49-07623e052dba","type":"message","text":"cool, thanks :slightly_smiling_face:","user":"U011V2YN59N","ts":"1616095377.003500","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"pUs8L","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"cool, thanks "},{"type":"emoji","name":"slightly_smiling_face"}]}]}]},{"client_msg_id":"5e153840-6ea2-44c4-aba5-95daeb2e29f2","type":"message","text":"Depends on the job.
