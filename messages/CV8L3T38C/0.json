Studies of COVID-19 prevalence were collected by conducting an online search of published articles, preprints, and government reports that were publicly disseminated prior to 18 September 2020. The systematic review encompassed 113 studies, of which 27 studies (covering 34 geographical locations) satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Age-specific IFRs were computed using the prevalence data in conjunction with reported fatalities 4 weeks after the midpoint date of the study, reflecting typical lags in fatalities and reporting. Meta-regression procedures in Stata were used to analyze the infection fatality rate (IFR) by age. Our analysis finds a exponential relationship between age and IFR for COVID-19. The estimated age-specific IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85. Moreover, our results indicate that about 90% of the variation in population IFR across geographical locations reflects differences in the age composition of the population and the extent to which relatively vulnerable age groups were exposed to the virus. These results indicate that COVID-19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualized risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza. Moreover, the overall IFR for COVID-19 should not be viewed as a fixed parameter but as intrinsically linked to the age-specific pattern of infections. Consequently, public health measures to mitigate infections in older adults could substantially decrease total deaths.","fallback":"European Journal of Epidemiology: Assessing the age specificity of infection fatality rates for COVID-19: systematic review, meta-analysis, and public policy implications","thumb_url":"https://media.springernature.com/w200/springer-static/cover/journal/10654.jpg","from_url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-020-00698-1","thumb_width":200,"thumb_height":266,"id":1,"original_url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-020-00698-1"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"knqV","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"link","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-020-00698-1"}]}]}],"reactions":[{"name":"clap","users":["U01CQTKB86N"],"count":1}]},{"client_msg_id":"3124069d-54fd-4b4f-a8dd-0d813cff326b","type":"message","text":"So ‘30% more’ is more for an 85 year-old than a 20 year-old?","user":"U01CQTKB86N","ts":"1611421208.027000","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"fjf","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"So ‘30% more’ is more for an 85 year-old than a 20 year-old?"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1611421208.027000","reply_count":3,"reply_users_count":3,"latest_reply":"1611585426.028600","reply_users":["U7JQGPGCQ","U6QGE7S86","U6C937ENB"],"subscribed":false},{"client_msg_id":"5270c019-1623-4c72-9864-71de5a439f2e","type":"message","text":"Mexican president has covid\n<https://mobile.twitter.com/lopezobrador_/status/1353500519344578560|https://mobile.twitter.com/lopezobrador_/status/1353500519344578560>","user":"U6QGE7S86","ts":"1611536308.028400","team":"T68168MUP","attachments":[{"fallback":"<https://twitter.com/lopezobrador_|@lopezobrador_>: Lamento informarles que estoy contagiado de COVID-19.

IgG to the Spike protein was relatively stable over 6+ months. Spike-specific memory B cells were more abundant at 6 months than at 1 month post symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells declined with a half-life of 3-5 months. By studying antibody, memory B cell, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T cell memory to SARS-CoV-2 in an integrated manner, we observed that each component of SARS-CoV-2 immune memory exhibited distinct kinetics.","fallback":"Science: Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to 8 months after infection","image_url":"https://science.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/highwire/sci/371/6526.cover-source.gif","ts":1609920000,"from_url":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/01/06/science.abf4063","image_width":197,"image_height":250,"image_bytes":135832,"service_icon":"https://science.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/images/favicon.ico","id":1,"original_url":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/01/06/science.abf4063"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"z3YnD","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hmm "},{"type":"link","url":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/01/06/science.abf4063","text":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/01/06/science.abf4063"}]}]}]},{"client_msg_id":"15b41629-1d65-45a6-a1ec-cee476d2ea1f","type":"message","text":"These studies and others31012 offer strong evidence that T cell immune responses are sustained, even in the face of declining or undetectable antibodies, implying that some immunity persists.

Initial focus was on defining virus neutralising antibodies from B cells after infection. Early reports indicated that such antibodies decline substantially over less than six months, raising questions about how long protective immunity might last following infection. T cells are also known to be important in protecting against many viral infections through processes known as cellular immunity. Defining the roles of T cells in covid-19 became a central focus for investigation.1 Both memory T cell and B cell responses specific to SARS-CoV-223 have now been found up to six months after infection. Similar T and B cell responses might be expected following vaccination, and may account for the good efficacy suggested by interim results from the three most advanced vaccine candidates.456 All three vaccines—two mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and …","fallback":"The BMJ: Covid-19 vaccines: delivering protective immunity","thumb_url":"https://www.bmj.com/sites/default/files/sites/defautl/files/attachments/bmj-article/2020/12/coronavirus_particles_0.jpg","ts":1608192000,"from_url":"https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4838","thumb_width":540,"thumb_height":350,"service_icon":"https://www.bmj.com/sites/default/themes/bmj/the_bmj/favicon.ico","id":1,"original_url":"https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4838"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"Xj3","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"From : "},{"type":"link","url":"https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4838","text":"https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4838"}]}]}]},{"client_msg_id":"aae09f04-4f7f-412c-b67a-94c164a809cd","type":"message","text":"How effective is t cell immunity without antibodies?","user":"UDGT4PM41","ts":"1611598303.035200","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"Rl+","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"How effective is t cell immunity without antibodies?"}]}]}]},{"client_msg_id":"ad226b49-7041-478b-8a42-73184b613bda","type":"message","text":"Really depends on the virus.
