an interesting article where my country comes on top in a good way. It’s probably true what they say in this, but Finland’s response has been nowhere near perfect. For example the question of masks has been controversial; in spring the health authorities commissioned a study that concluded that face masks are not useful. In fall they started saying that face masks are useful in crowded situations, and recently they suggest their use in shops and transportation. Face masks are not mandatory, and maybe 60%-80% use them based on my own observations. This weekend there was a lot of shopping going on in person, and I fear that will not go well with the virus, but we’ll see.\nOne thing I’d like to point out is that the compensation for lost income the article states is not just for the pandemic, it’s the normal state of affairs. You get sick, you stay home, you get most of the income anyway. I understand that in the US you mostly don’t get that compensation, so sick people are incentivised to stay at work when they’re slightly sick and infect others. I was myself tested once for covid-19, and it cost me zero euros; I got the time for the appointment for the test for the next day, and I got results in two days after that (negative), so our healthcare is also making it a lot easier to get tested.\n<https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/20/europe/europe-covid-restrictions/index.html>","user":"U01CQTKB86N","ts":"1608499122.474000","team":"T68168MUP","attachments":[{"service_name":"CNN","title":"Europe's coronavirus crisis is resurging.

It’s probably true what they say in this, but Finland’s response has been nowhere near perfect. For example the question of masks has been controversial; in spring the health authorities commissioned a study that concluded that face masks are not useful. In fall they started saying that face masks are useful in crowded situations, and recently they suggest their use in shops and transportation. Face masks are not mandatory, and maybe 60%-80% use them based on my own observations. This weekend there was a lot of shopping going on in person, and I fear that will not go well with the virus, but we’ll see.\nOne thing I’d like to point out is that the compensation for lost income the article states is not just for the pandemic, it’s the normal state of affairs. You get sick, you stay home, you get most of the income anyway. I understand that in the US you mostly don’t get that compensation, so sick people are incentivised to stay at work when they’re slightly sick and infect others.

The federal government answers questions from journalists every day and the local one at least once a week, but I have never seen that journalist come to ask questions directly from the people handling the pandemic. The public health system is enormous but it had been abandoned for decades (one of the two main social security institutions had not opened a new hospital in around 20 years and it just did). Fortunately the federal government had been investing in the system the last two years, and I think one of the few things the pandemic will leave is that it is really forcing an even larger investment in our old, long forgotten system."}]}]}],"reactions":[{"name":"+1","users":["UDSU53PEG","UB7JS9CHF"],"count":2}]},{"client_msg_id":"43a266b9-2d21-484f-a05b-f84316c46229","type":"message","text":"covid is certainly stress testing literally _everyone_ the Journal had an interesting opinion piece today: <https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-worse-than-2020-in-america-11609196039> it's always hard getting perspectives from outside one's own bubble","user":"UDSU53PEG","ts":"1609276073.110100","team":"T68168MUP","edited":{"user":"UDSU53PEG","ts":"1609276078.000000"},"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"5Wz","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"covid is certainly stress testing literally "},{"type":"text","text":"everyone","style":{"italic":true}},{"type":"text","text":" the Journal had an interesting opinion piece today: "},{"type":"link","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-worse-than-2020-in-america-11609196039"},{"type":"text","text":" it's always hard getting perspectives from outside one's own bubble"}]}]}]},{"client_msg_id":"91f0ddfa-a633-4094-ac5c-519d0d888344","type":"message","text":"<https://www.denverpost.com/2020/12/29/new-covid-19-variant-colorado/>","user":"US64J0NPQ","ts":"1609281442.110600","team":"T68168MUP","attachments":[{"service_name":"The Denver Post","title":"New, more contagious COVID-19 variant confirmed in Colorado","title_link":"https://www.denverpost.com/2020/12/29/new-covid-19-variant-colorado/","text":"Colorado public health officials on Tuesday confirmed the presence of the new variant of COVID-19 first discovered in the U.K., saying the state is the first to identify the strain in the U.S.","fallback":"The Denver Post: New, more contagious COVID-19 variant confirmed in Colorado","image_url":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TDP-L-COVID_TESTING_703.jpg?w=1024&h=683","image_width":375,"image_height":250,"ts":1609278066,"from_url":"https://www.denverpost.com/2020/12/29/new-covid-19-variant-colorado/","image_bytes":172232,"service_icon":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=180","id":1,"original_url":"https://www.denverpost.com/2020/12/29/new-covid-19-variant-colorado/"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"zag","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"link","url":"https://www.denverpost.com/2020/12/29/new-covid-19-variant-colorado/"}]}]}]},{"client_msg_id":"15dbb020-edb3-4d5b-8b8c-be933c0f16f2","type":"message","text":"How worrisome is this new strain?","user":"US64J0NPQ","ts":"1609281464.111200","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"yfZ","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"How worrisome is this new strain?"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1609281464.111200","reply_count":5,"reply_users_count":2,"latest_reply":"1609282347.112600","reply_users":["U6A936746","US64J0NPQ"],"subscribed":false},{"client_msg_id":"34535a23-f476-45b3-894d-3773bc4c99fc","type":"message","text":"I’m currently stuck sharing a house with somebody who 1) teaches 3-12 year olds 5 days a week in person 2) goes shopping a few times a week 3) is out with other people Friday night, as well as most of Saturday and Sunday.
