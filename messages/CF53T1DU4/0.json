Some sets use marbles in a board with indentations. The game is known simply as Solitaire in the United Kingdom where the card games are called Patience.  It is also referred to as Brainvita (mainly in India, where sets are sold commercially under this name).\nThe first evidence of the game can be traced back to the court of Louis XIV, and the specific date of 1697, with an engraving made ten years later by Claude Auguste Berey of Anne de Rohan-Chabot, Princess of Soubise, with the puzzle by her side.  The August 1687 edition of the French literary magazine Mercure galant contains a description of the board, rules and sample problems.  This is the first known reference to the game in print.\nThe standard game fills the entire board with pegs except for the central hole. The objective is, making valid moves, to empty the entire board except for a solitary peg in the central hole.","fallback":"wikipedia: Peg solitaire","service_icon":"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/unfurl_icons/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"SkErK","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"So I currently am having a mini-contest between a co-worker of mine about performance.\n\nHe claims that Java is one of the fastest languages for his toy-problem.\n\nI wrote a Julia version but my code currently runs at <2x the speed of his Java code.\n\nCan anyone suggest to me some ways to increase my performance?

Why `GC.gc()` does not garbage collect things if it is called within a loop that is in a function but does it when called in top-level scope? (within a function only `df1` and `df2` variables get binding except for some variables controlling looping - these variables are bound to other values earlier in the function but then are rebound as in the code above) CC <@U67431ELR>","user":"U8JAMQGQY","ts":"1612968087.157100","team":"T68168MUP","edited":{"user":"U8JAMQGQY","ts":"1612968229.000000"},"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"yc6u","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"When I run joining benchmarks in DataFrames.jl I get the following timing for "},{"type":"text","text":"llen=10^6","style":{"code":true}},{"type":"text","text":" and "},{"type":"text","text":"rlen=2*20^7","style":{"code":true}},{"type":"text","text":":\n"}]},{"type":"rich_text_preformatted","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"[ Info: sorted int duplicates many\n 34.686326 seconds (171 allocations: 2.454 GiB, 91.70% gc time)\n 34.366576 seconds (171 allocations: 2.454 GiB, 91.61% gc time)"}]},{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"when called from within a function.
