I don‚Äôt think unfounded naysaying is  any more correct than reckless overhyped speculation."}]}]}],"client_msg_id":"44f7e806-ac58-405e-9f95-eb447a4ca592"},{"client_msg_id":"998387e3-ffa5-4ba3-8fcf-e7e8aaafea6d","type":"message","text":"I just realized my 2-year-old‚Äôs favorite show (by a LONG shot) was co-created by the guy behind phd comics.","user":"U6740K1SP","ts":"1614032403.108100","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"g2kPP","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"I just realized my 2-year-old‚Äôs favorite show (by a LONG shot) was co-created by the guy behind phd comics."}]}]}]},{"client_msg_id":"a422977a-02f4-44c9-8ccd-17000ccfa4a0","type":"message","text":"what show?","user":"U011V2YN59N","ts":"1614032926.108600","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"Fpd","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"what show?"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1614032926.108600","reply_count":5,"reply_users_count":2,"latest_reply":"1614034955.111000","reply_users":["U6740K1SP","USU9FRPEU"],"subscribed":false},{"client_msg_id":"85437af9-e500-4020-9a76-7d756a63a9ba","type":"message","text":"I didn't realize that interplanetary video transmission had gotten this high of quality: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4czjS9h4Fpg>","user":"UDSU53PEG","ts":"1614036209.112100","team":"T68168MUP","attachments":[{"service_name":"YouTube","service_url":"https://www.youtube.com/","title":"Perseverance Rover‚Äôs Descent and Touchdown on Mars (Official NASA Video)","title_link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4czjS9h4Fpg","author_name":"NASA","author_link":"https://www.youtube.com/c/NASA","thumb_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4czjS9h4Fpg/hqdefault.jpg","thumb_width":480,"thumb_height":360,"fallback":"YouTube Video: Perseverance Rover‚Äôs Descent and Touchdown on Mars (Official NASA Video)","video_html":"<iframe width=\"400\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4czjS9h4Fpg?feature=oembed&autoplay=1&iv_load_policy=3\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","video_html_width":400,"video_html_height":225,"from_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4czjS9h4Fpg","service_icon":"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/unfurl_icons/youtube.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4czjS9h4Fpg"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"k5xs8","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"I didn't realize that interplanetary video transmission had gotten this high of quality: "},{"type":"link","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4czjS9h4Fpg"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1614036209.112100","reply_count":1,"reply_users_count":1,"latest_reply":"1614037648.112800","reply_users":["USU9FRPEU"],"subscribed":false,"reactions":[{"name":"mind_blown","users":["UGU761DU2","U0138UTB7A4","USU9FRPEU","U69KQT9DL","UB197FRCL"],"count":5},{"name":"100","users":["UGU761DU2","U9VG1AYSG","U969CNQU9","U0138UTB7A4","U9V8ZQVEY"],"count":5}]},{"client_msg_id":"ea038fc8-781f-470c-a4d0-69557ef9f7a4","type":"message","text":"I rmember a while back there was a discussion about a decent audio system for music.. does anyone remember what the <#C680MM7D4|random> consensus ended up being?","user":"U01GRS159T8","ts":"1614039251.115600","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"vAP","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"I rmember a while back there was a discussion about a decent audio system for music.. does anyone remember what the "},{"type":"channel","channel_id":"C680MM7D4"},{"type":"text","text":" consensus ended up being?"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1614039251.115600","reply_count":1,"reply_users_count":1,"latest_reply":"1614040854.115700","reply_users":["U0179G7FG4F"],"subscribed":false},{"client_msg_id":"5686714b-afbe-4f3f-a0ea-06401c269d31","type":"message","text":"<https://github.com/Sergio0694/ComputeSharp>","user":"UH24GRBLL","ts":"1614065919.119500","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"SSY","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"link","url":"https://github.com/Sergio0694/ComputeSharp"}]}]}]},{"client_msg_id":"0a35026e-16ab-4f9f-93a3-e998fdb13846","type":"message","text":"How to escalate an issue with a user reporting a Julia crash? <https://github.com/mschauer/Kalman.jl/issues/24>","user":"U6C937ENB","ts":"1614075217.126800","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"MpQu+","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"How to escalate an issue with a user reporting a Julia crash?
