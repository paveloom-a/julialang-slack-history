This might seem silly (newb here), but how do you guys run a julia script from the terminal? I understand the precompilation stuff in the REPL and that it is faster when run the next time but say I have a file `demo.jl` and run it from the terminal with `julia demo.jl`, it takes the same amount of time it would take when precompiling. So, in this case, I have to wait for a good amount of time before I see some output. Would be glad if someone could shed some light on this. Thanks.\n\nThis is unlike python, where simply running `python demo.py` would render the output regardless of the REPL or terminal environment.\nEDIT: Added context through python example.","user":"U01HFCRH5ML","ts":"1616954665.122400","team":"T68168MUP","edited":{"user":"U01HFCRH5ML","ts":"1616955340.000000"},"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"goc","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hi!
