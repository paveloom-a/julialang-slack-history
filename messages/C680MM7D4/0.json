COMEFROM is the inverse of GOTO in that it can take the execution state from any arbitrary point in code to a COMEFROM statement.\nThe point in code where the state transfer happens is usually given as a parameter to COMEFROM. Whether the transfer happens before or after the instruction at the specified transfer point depends on the language used. Depending on the language used, multiple COMEFROMs referencing the same departure point may be invalid, be non-deterministic, be executed in some sort of defined priority, or even induce parallel or otherwise concurrent execution as seen in Threaded Intercal.A simple example of a \"COMEFROM x\" statement is a label x (which does not need to be physically located anywhere near its corresponding COMEFROM) that acts as a \"trap door\". When code execution reaches the label, control gets passed to the statement following the COMEFROM. This may also be conditional, passing control only if a condition is satisfied, analogous to a GOTO within an IF statement. The primary difference from GOTO is that GOTO only depends on the local structure of the code, while COMEFROM depends on the global structure – a GOTO transfers control when it reaches a line with a GOTO statement, while COMEFROM requires scanning the entire program or scope to see if any COMEFROM statements are in scope for the line, and then verifying if a condition is hit. The effect of this is primarily to make debugging (and understanding the control flow of the program) extremely difficult, since there is no indication near the line or label in question that control will mysteriously jump to another point of the program – one must study the entire program to see if any COMEFROM statements reference that line or label.\nDebugger hooks can be used to implement a COMEFROM statement, as in the humorous Python goto module; see below. This also can be implemented with the gcc feature \"asm goto\" as used by the Linux kernel configuration option CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL. A no-op has its location stored, to be replaced by a jump to an executable fragment that at its end returns to the instruction after the no-op.","fallback":"wikipedia: COMEFROM","service_icon":"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/unfurl_icons/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMEFROM"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"I3nE","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"TIL the "},{"type":"text","text":"comefrom","style":{"code":true}},{"type":"text","text":" statement "},{"type":"link","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMEFROM","text":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMEFROM"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1608571812.413700","reply_count":34,"reply_users_count":5,"latest_reply":"1608637151.446300","reply_users":["U6795JH6H","UPUBAM63X","UH24GRBLL","U67BXBF99","UB7JS9CHF"],"subscribed":false,"reactions":[{"name":"anguished","users":["UEN48T0BT","U67G3QRJM"],"count":2},{"name":"+1","users":["U6A936746"],"count":1},{"name":"laughing","users":["UGU761DU2","U93BUBZP0","U8T0YV7QC"],"count":3}]},{"client_msg_id":"19e0a83c-7e4c-45ea-9c26-6181105fcc79","type":"message","text":"TIL Fortran is getting a package manager ... written in Fortran\n<https://medium.com/modern-fortran/first-year-of-fortran-lang-d8796bfa0067>","user":"U6QGE7S86","ts":"1608573032.414300","team":"T68168MUP","attachments":[{"service_name":"Medium","title":"First year of Fortran-lang","title_link":"https://medium.com/modern-fortran/first-year-of-fortran-lang-d8796bfa0067","text":"Last week marked one year since the birth of the Fortran-lang open source community.

The result? A neural net that was very confused about how Christmas works: King of toys and hippopotamuses [sic] full of the light of that stood at the dear Son of Santa Claus He was born in a wonderful christmas tree Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolf the new born King. You can kind of understand where the confusion came from. But that was 2017, when I was training char-rnn from scratch on my laptop. Now in 2019 I have access to the much more powerful GPT-2, trained by OpenAI on 40GB of text from the internet. GPT-2 runs on the big processors on Google Cloud (through Max Woolf’s gpt-2-simple colab notebook), and has much better memory than char-rnn (which struggled to complete a single sentence). Did GPT-2 learn enough about the way words like Santa + reindeer are mentioned online versus Jesus + manger to figure out how to separate multiple kinds of carols? I gave the same 240 carols to the smallest version of GPT-2 (the 124M size), and then asked it what comes after “Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer”. Here’s what it added. Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, with its red belly The All-gracious King of all the earth, Had a baby at Christmas time, On Christmas Day, A true and holy Deity, Went down to earth, With human flesh for sacrifice. For sinful men such a Deity doth appear, And wink and nod in reply, As he winked and nod in reply, As he winked and nod in reply The wretched world is run by ox and ass The wretched world is run by ox and ass, And in vain build I. Using a more powerful neural net has apparently made the problem EVEN WORSE. The neural net is still confused about who exactly had that baby at Christmas time. And, most unfortunately, the neural net apparently saw that the word “flesh” appeared in the carols several times (Thank you, good king Wenceslas), as did the words “sacrifice” and “human”, and so it helpfully suggests “human flesh for sacrifice” as a likely phrase based on how it saw those words used online. Some of the neural net’s renditions of Rudolph are disturbing in much more surrealistic ways. Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer I was riding by a hansom lettering me On Christmas morning, The snow was everywhere; And the wind was cruel and cruel Against me like ants, Like ants, like ants. Or this rendition, which I swear to god is verbatim Rudolph the Red Nosed reindeer Was the best sleigh in all of Nantucket The horse was lean and tanned The woman was full of perfume The only thing keeping the goose from falling off the ground Was the reins Like strings of spaghetti And if you could just cut it down You could even make a bow Like a bow and arrow But if you wanted to make a bow you had to use a lot of power Right down to the little lamb Its red head was covered in feathers Its heart was full of sugar And the most prized food item was its head Everywhere in the barn there were beavers’ eyes Some would go, “Where is the sugar?” But to them it was simple, it came from a good source And they found sugar in olden times Families that lived in the stable all had it I can also get the neural net to generate custom carols. Here’s what it produced when I asked it to write “The Carol of the AIs” and I can’t tell whether it has misunderstood what Christmas carols are all about, or understood some of them only too well. Carol of the AI’s Come and own the yacht It’s a very special day, It’s a very special day We’re all so proud of you We’re buying this We’re buying this now Now it’s Christmas eve And everyone’s shouting “Santa Claus!” “HO HO HO!” It’s a very special day It’s a very special day It’s a very special day One downside to using a neural net that was pretrained on a bunch of general internet text is that some of its carols involve an improbable level of swearing and gun violence. You can read the full versions of those (and a few others). My book on AI is out, and, you can now get it any of these several ways!
