Just like 2020, tickets are free, but registration in advance is required. Workshops will be held the week before with more details coming later in 2021. JuliaCon 2020 received more than 10,000 registrations, and this year we hope to surpass that. Register to make sure you don't miss the best technical computing conference of the year! <http://juliacon.org/> About Julia --------------- Julia is the fastest high-performance open source computing language for data, analytics, algorithmic trading, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other scientific and numeric computing applications. Julia solves the two language problem by combining the ease of use of Python and R with the speed of C++. Julia works with GPUs, TPUs, multithreading and parallel processing to deliver seamless unlimited scalability from a single CPU to thousands of nodes, cores and threads in the public or private cloud. Julia has run at petascale on 9,300 Knights Landing (KNL) nodes with 650,000 cores and 1.3 million threads to analyze over 56 terabytes of data using Cori, one of the ten largest and most powerful supercomputers in the world. Julia has been downloaded more than 12 million times and is used at more than 1,500 universities. Julia co-creators are the winners of the 2019 James H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software and the 2019 Sidney Fernbach Award. Registration ----------------- Attendance will be free, but registration will still be required to access the conference. Registration can be done on the JuliaCon 2021 website (<https://juliacon.org/>( Topics Covered: ------------------------- * Machine Learning, Scientific Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data Analytics * High-Performance Computing * Artificial Intelligence, Probabilistic Programming, Bayesian Statistics * Computer Vision, Image Processing, Engineering * Quantitative Finance, Risk Management, Equity Analysis * Mathematics, Differential Equations * Biology, Biomedical Sciences * Astronomy, Astrophysics * Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Drug Development, Drug Discovery Staying Informed ------------------------ To stay up to date with JuliaCon's announcements, please follow us on * LinkedIn (<http://www.linkedin.com/company/teamjuliacon|www.linkedin.com/company/teamjuliacon>) * Twitter (<http://www.twitter.com/JuliaConOrg|www.twitter.com/JuliaConOrg>) * Facebook (<http://www.facebook.com/JuliaConOrg|www.facebook.com/JuliaConOrg>) Kindest Regards, The JuliaCon 2021 organizing committee","fallback":"JuliaCon 2021 (free and virtual) | LinkedIn","thumb_url":"https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C561EAQEYByA8E5Tlig/event-background-image-shrink_200_800/0/1611003772960?e=1613077200&v=beta&t=Zr5apmv5CtJhrsaz511wP5-l-OiyUh4guvVdAbEYgV8","from_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/events/6746462348694958080/","thumb_width":800,"thumb_height":200,"service_icon":"https://static-exp1.licdn.com/sc/h/al2o9zrvru7aqj8e1x2rzsrca","service_name":"linkedin.com","id":1,"original_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/events/6746462348694958080/"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"H=33Q","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Wow, 6,580 people already clicked \"Attend Event\" for JuliaCon 2021??
