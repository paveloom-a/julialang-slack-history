This is typically associated with hardware or software systems, where the specification contains liveness requirements (such as avoidance of livelock) as well as safety requirements (such as avoidance of states representing a system crash).\nIn order to solve such a problem algorithmically, both the model of the system and its specification are formulated in some precise mathematical language. To this end, the problem is formulated as a task in logic, namely to check whether a structure satisfies a given logical formula. This general concept applies to many kinds of logic and many kinds of structures. A simple model-checking problem consists of verifying whether a formula in the propositional logic is satisfied by a given structure.","fallback":"wikipedia: Model checking","service_icon":"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/unfurl_icons/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_checking"}],"blocks":[{"type":"section","block_id":"matterbridge_c1l3qqkg27iehe2iuovg","text":{"type":"mrkdwn","text":"you might want to read up on model checking <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_checking>","verbatim":false}}],"edited":{"user":"B795XHD0X","ts":"1617891028.000000"}},{"type":"message","subtype":"bot_message","text":"I will thank you","ts":"1617891081.025600","username":"[irc] <tatsumaru>","bot_id":"B795XHD0X","blocks":[{"type":"section","block_id":"matterbridge_c1l3qqkg27iehe2iuovg","text":{"type":"mrkdwn","text":"I will thank you","verbatim":false}}]},{"type":"message","subtype":"bot_message","text":"similar things like <https://www.frama-c.com/> can verify inputs and outputs for a given C/C++ function provided you tell it what the expected input and output is","ts":"1617891126.025700","username":"[irc] <AnAverageHuman>","bot_id":"B795XHD0X","attachments":[{"title":"Frama-C - Framework for Modular Analysis of C programs","title_link":"https://www.frama-c.com/","text":"Frama-C - An open-source extensible and collaborative platform dedicated to source-code analysis of C software.","fallback":"Frama-C - Framework for Modular Analysis of C programs","from_url":"https://www.frama-c.com/","service_icon":"https://www.frama-c.com/assets/img/favicon.ico","service_name":"frama-c.com","id":1,"original_url":"https://www.frama-c.com/"}],"blocks":[{"type":"section","block_id":"matterbridge_c1l3qqkg27iehe2iuovg","text":{"type":"mrkdwn","text":"similar things like <https://www.frama-c.com/> can verify inputs and outputs for a given C/C++ function provided you tell it what the expected input and output is","verbatim":false}}],"edited":{"user":"B795XHD0X","ts":"1617891127.000000"}},{"type":"message","subtype":"bot_message","text":"AnAverageHuman what about my original question?","ts":"1617891230.025900","username":"[irc] <tatsumaru>","bot_id":"B795XHD0X","blocks":[{"type":"section","block_id":"matterbridge_c1l3qqkg27iehe2iuovg","text":{"type":"mrkdwn","text":"AnAverageHuman what about my original question?","verbatim":false}}]},{"type":"message","subtype":"bot_message","text":"to my knowledge no such checker for the language exists yet","ts":"1617891365.026000","username":"[irc] <AnAverageHuman>","bot_id":"B795XHD0X","blocks":[{"type":"section","block_id":"matterbridge_c1l3qqkg27iehe2iuovg","text":{"type":"mrkdwn","text":"to my knowledge no such checker for the language exists yet","verbatim":false}}]},{"type":"message","subtype":"bot_message","text":"is it the checkers that mainly increase the safety potential of a language","ts":"1617891408.026100","username":"[irc] <tatsumaru>","bot_id":"B795XHD0X","blocks":[{"type":"section","block_id":"matterbridge_c1l3qqkg27iehe2iuovg","text":{"type":"mrkdwn","text":"is it the checkers that mainly increase the safety potential of a language","verbatim":false}}]},{"type":"message","subtype":"bot_message","text":"the ability to have such safety contracts and checkers for these contracts increases the safety potential.
