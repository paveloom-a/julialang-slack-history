I will be giving a brief 20 min-ish talk tomorrow in Spanish called “Considering Julia”. It will be in Spanish, the link is below. I will be pre-recording a longer version (á la JuliaCon) so that I can talk about the things I want without feeling rushed :smiley: This was in part facilitated by @categulario (not yet here) and @xalapacode, a Mexican local coding org.
