My workaround for the moment is to replace `A\\B`  with `A\\convert(Matrix, B)` , but I would like it to not allocate extra memory if `B` is already dense. This should work right? Any other pointers as to how to do this well? My package uses many different Matrix-types and ideally I would like to code everything in a way that is highly type-agnostic yet efficient.","user":"U01L0RJC6FM","ts":"1615998035.029100","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"jz=GZ","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"hi guys.. i keep running into the problem of "},{"type":"text","text":"SparseArrays","style":{"code":true}},{"type":"text","text":"  not allowing sparse right-hand sides.
