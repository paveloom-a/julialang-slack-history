Back when I used to code in Java, autocomplete on an object would instantly show me all the available methods. While the language itself was sometimes limited, I was confident I was using all of what was available. In Julia, I’m confident that I’m NOT using all that is available. I know the situation is harder with multiple dispatch, but how do you all learn about functionality quickly?\nI think my issues generally fall into two categories. First, basic, stupid questions that I probably missed or forgot the first time I read through the docs. Things like “how do I create a typed array?” took me an inordinately long time to find (`FLoat32[1.0, 2.0]`) when my first guess of `Array{Float32, 1}(1.0, 2.0)` didn’t work. Maybe this is just a failing of my search methods, but what has worked for learning other languages hasn’t worked as well for Julia especially for manipulating arrays and IndexedTables. Second, there seem to be a lot of syntactical tricks that I keep coming across. For instance, `Float32[1.0, 2.0]` creates a 1D array but `Float32[1.0 2.0]` creates a 2D array. How do I discover more of those?","user":"U01RFH03171","ts":"1616184389.230000","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"vEMb","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Second, as I’m learning Julia, I’m having some trouble discovering Julia functionality.
