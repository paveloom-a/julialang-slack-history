Being a newb at programming and Linux, I seem to have borked my system somehow. I was trying to follow along Tom Kwong's awesome video on TextAnalysis.jl, when I started experiencing some weird problems loading OhMyREPL and Pluto. Both packages seem to precompile forever, and then I get `StackOverflowError`s. My question is whether to report these as issues/bugs, and if so where? I downloaded `rr` and created a trace of my startup (since I had OhMyREPL in my `startup.jl` file). Given that I am getting the same error for two different packages, I don't think this needs to be reported under either but perhaps under the Julia project itself.","user":"UM3JZTC3D","ts":"1608835619.479600","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"b/D","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hello everyone, not sure where to post this.
