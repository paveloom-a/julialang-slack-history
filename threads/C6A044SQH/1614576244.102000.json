The script.jl bottlenecks in I/O operation (read/write), so I implemented multi-threading on it. Note that the julia call I ran in both via cli and via another app is exact same command.\n\nI also couldn't replicate this issue in my Ubuntu machine although running it via another app's call. This seems to be a really weird issue since we didn't see this before.\n\nHere's what I'm going to try:\n1. Running just `run(\"script.jl\")`  to validate this is not caused by any other part of my app.\n2. If that doesn't work it means the issue is with the `run` function on multi-threaded app? So I think I will try updating the Julia version to v1.5.3.\n3. If that doesn't solve my issue, then I will try running it on another Windows machine to see if it's the machine specific, or just Windows in general.\nAny thoughts on this?\nThanks!","user":"UUT4VGTE2","ts":"1614576244.102000","team":"T68168MUP","edited":{"user":"UUT4VGTE2","ts":"1614576754.000000"},"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"BY5","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hi guys, is there any known multi-threading issue in Windows 10 (Julia v1.3.1) when running a Julia script via "},{"type":"text","text":"run","style":{"code":true}},{"type":"text","text":" command?\n\nEverything works fine in my colleague's Windows machine when running the script via command line directly, but when calling it via another app, i.e. "},{"type":"text","text":"run(`julia script.jl`)","style":{"code":true}},{"type":"text","text":"  (in this case, script.jl is the multi-threaded script), this just stuck randomly without any pattern (no error message/meaningful insights in debug logs, although I have set JULIA_DEBUG=\"all\").
