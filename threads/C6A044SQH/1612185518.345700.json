Suppose I want to code a function that returns a `SVector` but each component is computed inside the function without knowing the size. Should I create a `MVector` and then cast that to a `SVector`? This is what I am thinking:\n```function test(::Val{D}) where {D}\n    mv = @MVector zeros(D)\n\n    for i in 1:D\n        mv[i] = i + 1\n    end\n\n    sv = convert(SVector, mv)\n    return sv\nend```\nThen:\n```test(Val{4}())```\ndoes not allocate and is type stable. But I don’t know if this is the correct approach.
