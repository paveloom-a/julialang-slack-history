I have a code (a solver for linear systems) which should have quasilinear complexity in solving linear systems. Unfortunately I have one bottleneck which is extracting submatrices `A[i,j]` from the big sparse matrix. This should be an O(n log n) operation but it seems that the current implementation is infuriatingly slow and O(n^2). I have found some closed threads on discourse but it is unclear what the current status is on that. Any hints?","user":"U01L0RJC6FM","ts":"1617729175.085200","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"jrF","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hi, a question on "},{"type":"text","text":"SparseMatrixCSC","style":{"code":true}},{"type":"text","text":" .
