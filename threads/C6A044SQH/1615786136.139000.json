I notice that as per docs page <https://yuehhua.github.io/GeometricFlux.jl/dev/basics/passgraph/>, to pass a variable graph you need to define the `GCNConv` layer by passing in a `FeaturedGraph`. However, the `FeaturedGraph` is constructed by taking in an adjacency matrix, meaning that you need to know the graph structure before defining the GNN. Am I missing something and does functionality exist so that a given GNN can take in more than one kind of graph structure?","user":"UNB36FC95","ts":"1615786136.139000","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"5pXnz","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"I'm looking into using "},{"type":"link","url":"https://github.com/yuehhua/GeometricFlux.jl"},{"type":"text","text":".
