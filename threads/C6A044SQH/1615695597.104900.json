I have a rosenbrock function that takes 2 values and returns 1 value. So I was trying to run this as a comprehension, but I am getting out a (401,401) array, instead of a (401,1) array. Here is the code.\n```x = -2:0.01:2\ny = -2:0.01:2\nrosenbrock(x,p) =  (p[1] - x[1])^2 + p[2] * (x[2] - x[1]^2)^2\nz = [rosenbrock([i, j], p) for i=x, j=y]```\nBut I keep getting out a (401,401) array instead of a 401,1 array. Now it makes sense that the comprehension is iterating over the `i` and `j` dimensions, so there are probably repeated entries. But still I was not clear on how to fix this. I tried parenthesis `(i=x, j=y)`.\n\nAlternatively, if I do.\n```z2 = map((x, y) -&gt; rosenbrock([x,y], p), x, y)```\nThen it works out fine and I get a (401, 1) array,","user":"UDDSTBX19","ts":"1615695597.104900","team":"T68168MUP","edited":{"user":"UDDSTBX19","ts":"1615696057.000000"},"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"/MAT","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hey julians.
