I have a Vector `y` defined with respect to a time vector `t`. The thing is, `t` is not equi-spaced. I want to interpolate `y` on a regular, equispaced grid.

In fact, Interpolations.jl does not require the definition of the input array `y` with respect to some given \"time\" or \"coordinate\" axis, simply the indices of `y` is enough.\n\nAm I missing something and what I want to do can be done with Interpolations.jl...?","user":"U8J1KET6K","ts":"1616514634.459400","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"eJ5","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hi, I think I might be missing something about interpolation in Julia.
