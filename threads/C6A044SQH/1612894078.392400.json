I'm wondering how best to represent such \"sometimes-fixed-sometimes-variable\" points in Julia?\n\nNaively, I was thinking of something like\n```struct VariablePoint\n    cnst::Vector{Float64}\n    expr::Expr\n    is_cnst_or_expr::Bool\nend```\nand then defining an overload on `VariablePoint` for input parameters that goes either to `cnst` or `eval(expr)` depending on `is_cnst_or_expr`. That feels wrong though because it needs `eval`.","user":"UCE6XE42Z","ts":"1612894078.392400","team":"T68168MUP","edited":{"user":"UCE6XE42Z","ts":"1612894133.000000"},"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"Bhxy","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"I have a use-case where I have lists of predefined \"special\" points: usually, these points are ordinary vectors of floats, but occasionally, they depend on some external variables via some simple algebraic expression, e.g. "},{"type":"text","text":"[0.0, a*b/c, 0.5]","style":{"code":true}},{"type":"text","text":" (with external variables "},{"type":"text","text":"a","style":{"code":true}},{"type":"text","text":", "},{"type":"text","text":"b","style":{"code":true}},{"type":"text","text":" and "},{"type":"text","text":"c","style":{"code":true}},{"type":"text","text":").
