[{"type":"message","text":"Hi! I'm trying to use Julia for a bunch of image processing related tasks. My content is in EXR, which doesn't seem to have good support (A bit in ImageMagick, but I think I need more comprehensive support). I have pretty good experience with OpenEXR's C++ API, but none with Julia's FFI and very little with Julia. If I were interested in creating a OpenEXR package, any tips? It looks like there might be a semi-standard image loading interface to try to fit?","user":"U01T0B2F03H","ts":"1617736790.097100","team":"T68168MUP","thread_ts":"1617736790.097100","reply_count":3,"reply_users_count":2,"latest_reply":"1617740163.099900","reply_users":["U01T0B2F03H","USU9FRPEU"],"is_locked":false,"subscribed":false},{"type":"message","text":"I guess specifically tips/references for integrating the build system would be especially useful.
