More precisely I have function `A`  which I execute on similar inputs of similiar size. The weird thing is that if I do this 4 times as much I would expect it to take 4 times as long but instead it takes 40 times longer. I know this thanks to `TimerOutputs.jl`  and I am not quite sure how to explain this behavior. I suspect memory and using Swap might be behind it. How could I test this hypothesis in Julia?
