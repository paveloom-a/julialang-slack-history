I am looking at the source of <https://github.com/chakravala/Fatou.jl/blob/master/src/Fatou.jl|Fatou.jl> to understand how their implementation of the Mandelbrot visualization is faster. I have a couple of questions:\n1. The `n` variable they have used is for horizontal grid points. Is that the same as the num of pixels/coordinates calculated? So it calculates for 176x176 pixels by default?\n2. It's `N` is UInt8, and it means the maximum iteration per coordinate (or complex coordinate) is just 255. I've read that you would need atleast a value of 1000 for max iteration for the visualization to be quite accurate. Is this actually restricted to 255 or am I just confusing `N` with max iteration?\n3. Does anyone have a fast Mandelbrot visualization in Julia (without using GPU) which runs well for 1920x1080 images?","user":"U01PP5BA1C4","ts":"1614356953.498600","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"d+3r","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hi.
