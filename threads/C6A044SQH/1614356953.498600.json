I am looking at the source of <https://github.com/chakravala/Fatou.jl/blob/master/src/Fatou.jl|Fatou.jl> to understand how their implementation of the Mandelbrot visualization is faster.

So it calculates for 176x176 pixels by default?\n2. It's `N` is UInt8, and it means the maximum iteration per coordinate (or complex coordinate) is just 255. I've read that you would need atleast a value of 1000 for max iteration for the visualization to be quite accurate. Is this actually restricted to 255 or am I just confusing `N` with max iteration?\n3.
