order I would expect this:\n```function r_col_loop(x::Array{T}) where T\n    N = size(x,2)\n    r = Array{T,1}(undef,N)\n\n    @inbounds for i = 1:N\n        x2 = 0.0\n        for dim = 1:3\n            x2 += x[dim, i]^2\n        end\n        r[i] = √( x2 )\n    end\n    return r\nend```\nto be faster than this:\n```function r_row_loop(x::Array{T}) where T\n    N = size(x,1)\n    r =

time it I get:\n```x_row = rand(1_000_000, 3)\n@btime r_row_loop($x_row)\n    1.770 ms (2 allocations: 7.63 MiB)\n\nx_col = rand(3, 1_000_000)\n@btime r_col_loop($x_col)\n    1.965 ms (2 allocations: 7.63 MiB)```\nThe difference is even larger when I use broadcasting with `@views`:\n```function r_row_dot(x::Array{T}) where T\n    @views @. √( x[:,1]^2 + x[:,2]^2 + x[:,3]^2)\nend\n@btime

out?","user":"U0104GF2B6F","ts":"1610361942.285300","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"QxV6","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hi
