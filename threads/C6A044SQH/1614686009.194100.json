I have a bunch of files with various functions separated logically, and I want to combine the various files.

I saw <https://discourse.julialang.org/t/best-way-to-structure-julia-code/26591/17> but that's only one piece of it. A c++ project I'd expect `include/`, `src/` and `tst/` for instance, with the same subfolder structure. Is there a julian style folder structure? I'd like to fix good habits in the jump from single file to multiple file julia work.\n\nShould each file have a module? Is there a standard folder structure? Do you place unit test files alongside the source file or in the test directory?\n\nI'd like to avoid reinventing the wheel on this, as I am sure there's some terrible choices I might make accidentally. It seems like placing them wherever, and `include(\"XXX.jl\"); using .XXX` is the approach, where `XXX` is a file local module. Or is this a naive approach? This isn't for a big widely shared project, just personal, but I don't want to get into bad habits.","user":"U01CLS9TSQ1","ts":"1614686009.194100","team":"T68168MUP","attachments":[{"service_name":"JuliaLang","title":"Best way to structure Julia code","title_link":"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/best-way-to-structure-julia-code/26591/17","text":"Thanks.
