Is it possible to make a fully interactive notebook running Julia code on a static website with no server code (e,g. buttons, sliders, plots, and manipulating graphics, etc.)?

I also found some talk on converting Julia to WebAssembly and JavaScript which seems relevant, but that also seemed too low level and I was hoping for something more straightforward.
