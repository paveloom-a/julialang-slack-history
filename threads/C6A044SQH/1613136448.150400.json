It never seems to pick up my new changes. even when i change the sub version in the toml file, and it picks up the version change, it still doesnt pick up the actual code change. Any advice would be much appreciate :)","user":"U01MWNUGFUL","ts":"1613136448.150400","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"jiU","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"HI, I'm having issues with the julia workflow I have cloned a repo checked out my own branch, done some changes, committed them, but no matter what I do in the julia repl, update, rm and re add, precompile, restarting julia, activating the branch workspace and trying from there, using dev instead of add.
