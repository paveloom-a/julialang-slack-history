I love the language, it is what I find to be the most powerful and intuitive language that I have ever used. It's undoubtedly my favorite language. That said, there are some \"gotchas\", tricky little things you need to know about. Every language has them, and one of the first things you have to do in order to master a language is to find out what they are and how to avoid them. The point of this blog post is to help accelerate this process for you by exposing some of the most common \"gotchas\" offering alternative programming practices. Julia is a good language for understanding what's going on because there's no magic. The Julia developers like to have clearly defined rules for how things act. This means that all behavior ...
