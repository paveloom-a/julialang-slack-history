I’m trying to understand how this code works.  In particular, I don’t quite understand how the inner-axis is being positioned within the super-axis.\nI think my confusion is arising because of the difference between coordinates within the “scene” vs within the “axis” object.  I don’t think the coordinates within the axis align with the coordinates within the scene--and so when I try to position the sub-axis using a bbox in super-axis coordinates, it doesn’t end up quite where I expect it to, since I think it’s using scene (rather than axis) coordinates.\n\nIn general, I would like to have a setup along the lines of:\n• I have a super-axis which always resizes to the window size, scaling everything inside it.  The super-axis always exposes an interface where the coordinates are (say) a grid with x, y between 0 and 100\n• I can plot sub-axes within the super-axis, selecting their bounding boxes using the super-axis’s 0-100 coordinates (regardless of eg. how many pixels are on the screen)\n• Each sub-axis independently has its own coordinate system (say again in range 0-100 for x and y), and I can plot into the sub-axes without regard for the super-axis coordinates\nAny guidance on how to achieve this would be super helpful!
