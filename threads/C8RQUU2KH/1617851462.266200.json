I saw this but I wasn't sure how using a `Node` would work with what I had. \n\nRight now I have a function `plot_mesh(a)` that creates u,v coordinates based on the parameter `a` (e.g. `u = range(0, a*pi, length=100)`), then takes the cartesian product of u,v arrays and maps it all to x,y,z using a 3D Klein bottle parametrization. With all the x,y,z values, it plots them using `surface!` \n\nSince the mesh creation has multiple steps I wasn't sure how use to Nodes with it.
