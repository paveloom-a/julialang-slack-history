Where it is used. What parameter ranges result in this behavior and Julia code.\nThat might be a really good way to get citations. OEIS has 8700+ citations.\nI only see the problem that identifying dynamical systems is (way) more expensive than indexing sequences.\n\nIs this something people would pay for to have more features/longer computation time?\n","user":"U9MD78Z9N","ts":"1611527512.036700","thread_ts":"1611512263.031300","root":{"client_msg_id":"b0b661c6-5345-415e-8d66-32c53b352e7b","type":"message","text":"is there an OEIS like db for dynamical systems (not necessarily in julia)? often i find my self googling \"X dynamics\" and then searching thru either wiki or research papers to get the model. itd be nice to be able to do this and get back a DE.jl problem","user":"UM8JUNJG7","ts":"1611512263.031300","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"LPm","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"is there an OEIS like db for dynamical systems (not necessarily in julia)? often i find my self googling \"X dynamics\" and then searching thru either wiki or research papers to get the model. itd be nice to be able to do this and get back a DE.jl problem"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1611512263.031300","reply_count":5,"reply_users_count":2,"latest_reply":"1611528166.044000","reply_users":["U9MD78Z9N","UM8JUNJG7"],"subscribed":false},"edited":{"user":"U9MD78Z9N","ts":"1611527579.000000"}},{"type":"message","text":"BTW the name OEDS (on-line enclyclopedia of dynamical systems) isn't taken by something with high google weight.","user":"U9MD78Z9N","ts":"1611527663.037100","team":"T68168MUP","thread_ts":"1611512263.031300","parent_user_id":"UM8JUNJG7","reactions":[{"name":"heart","users":["UM8JUNJG7","U0179G7FG4F","U01J854TZ0V"],"count":3}]},{"client_msg_id":"5c3468d0-0f49-4ccc-8879-23e4ed227d92","type":"message","text":"haha i was thinking the same thing!","user":"UM8JUNJG7","ts":"1611527710.037300","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"WKs","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"haha i was thinking the same thing!"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1611512263.031300","parent_user_id":"UM8JUNJG7"},{"type":"message","text":"I also like that it's an palindrom of ODEs.","user":"U9MD78Z9N","ts":"1611527901.039800","team":"T68168MUP","edited":{"user":"U9MD78Z9N","ts":"1611527913.000000"},"thread_ts":"1611512263.031300","parent_user_id":"UM8JUNJG7","reactions":[{"name":"rolling_on_the_floor_laughing","users":["UM8JUNJG7"],"count":1}]},{"type":"message","text":".org and .net and .com are already taken :-(","user":"U9MD78Z9N","ts":"1611528166.044000","team":"T68168MUP","thread_ts":"1611512263.031300","parent_user_id":"UM8JUNJG7"}]
