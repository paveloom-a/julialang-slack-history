[{"type":"message","text":"A question about (noisy) stochastic reaction networks:\nThe rule x -&gt; x + x does provides a triggerable (just add one x) exponential growth, however it can't be used in stochastics systems, as random fluctuations  in concentration would likely trigger exponential growth at an unwanted moment.\nDoes someone know a reaction network that is robust to noise in concentration of all of it's components and stable but some particular input(change in concentration of one or more components) triggers exponential (or logistic) growth in one component?\nI know that some mechanism like that exists in biology.","user":"U9MD78Z9N","ts":"1611621055.052600","team":"T68168MUP","edited":{"user":"U9MD78Z9N","ts":"1611621693.000000"},"thread_ts":"1611621055.052600","reply_count":2,"reply_users_count":2,"latest_reply":"1611641935.054300","reply_users":["U017LQ3A59U","U9MD78Z9N"],"subscribed":false},{"client_msg_id":"0a997ca6-fc71-4e76-9a0b-fb85359c5e19","type":"message","text":"Isn't a chemical switch doing what you describe?
