Can anyone suggest the best reference or resource to understand the discretization properties of neural ODEs. Meaning if I put an ODE into a loss function, then that should not be anything new since an existing solver would just solve the ODE for the ODE component of the loss function. But if I include an NN to represent some unmodeled physics in an ODE system, then I am not sure what happens to the discretization scheme for the augmented system. I the Universal Differential Equations paper the right place to look for this, or is there a better place to get a sense of the issues or properties of these NN augmented systems.","user":"UDDSTBX19","ts":"1616455802.120800","team":"T68168MUP","edited":{"user":"UDDSTBX19","ts":"1616455844.000000"},"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"RM8A","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hey "},{"type":"user","user_id":"U69BL50BF"},{"type":"text","text":" or anyone out there.
