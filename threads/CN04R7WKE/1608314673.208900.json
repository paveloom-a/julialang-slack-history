I was really just wondering what kinds of models you were using. I am working on a discrete stochastic simulation, looking at hiring practices in universities. So it is genuinely discrete because the hiring tends to happen at the beginning of a school year, and retirements happen at the end of the school year. There are many books on continuous time SDEs, etc, but not that much on discrete stochastic simulations. Chris just said I might be able to use some of the approaches in your package. But if you don't want to share yet, that is cool. But really I was just wondering what kinds of models you were using.
