Example:\nDynamic process optimization stuff is usually discretized in fixed time steps and then handed of to an NLP/QP solvers, this makes systematic exploration of the kind of discretization/integration rule or using a simplified dynamic to get a first estimate impossible without human intervention.\nTransforming a control problems into an multiple shooting usually involves rewriting the system to generate the sensitivites of the shooting points which wasn't usually done either.","user":"U9MD78Z9N","ts":"1610132358.261600","team":"T68168MUP","thread_ts":"1610121801.256000","parent_user_id":"U6A936746"}]
