Moreover, it is based on the Transformer-XL structure which is one of hottest topics in NLP these days. \n\nAnother project idea is the implementation of RoBERTa which sounds quite feasible. It is also quite robust and outperforms BERT.\n\nThis is a brief idea of the project that I have been looking forward to for GSOC-2021. \nPlease suggest me how to proceed next. \nI am looking forward to discussing it with the mentors. \nHave a great day. :smile:","user":"U0183KL21GS","ts":"1616320357.017000","team":"T68168MUP","edited":{"user":"U0183KL21GS","ts":"1616325037.000000"},"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"UbL","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hi everyone,\nThis is Sambhaw.\nI have been contributing in JuliaText and Flux for the past few months.\nI feel that XLNET model can be a great addition to NLP in Julia.
