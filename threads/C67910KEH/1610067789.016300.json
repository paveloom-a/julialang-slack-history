I’ll start working on my thesis in the next months. The background idea is to implement an effect system for a functional programming language, similar to Koka. Koka’s formalization helped with extensive static analysis to generate code that does not need garbage collection at runtime. I liked Julia’s LISP-like metaprogramming features a lot, something which OCaml (the other candidate lang for my work) sort of lacks. Metaprogramming simply makes the job eas...","fallback":"JuliaLang: Are there Julia operational semantics available?","thumb_url":"https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business5/uploads/julialang/original/2X/1/12829a7ba92b924d4ce81099cbf99785bee9b405.png","ts":1610065236,"from_url":"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/are-there-julia-operational-semantics-available/52923/4","thumb_width":408,"thumb_height":263,"service_icon":"https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business5/uploads/julialang/optimized/2X/6/6ca888e296f59ca2a599807f7d5edd489e3d1829_2_180x180.png","id":2,"original_url":"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/are-there-julia-operational-semantics-available/52923/4"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"7/+","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"fyi, if anyone is interested in Julia + Static typing, feel free to joing the zulip thread "},{"type":"link","url":"https://julialang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/137791-general/topic/Static.20typing.20.2F.20static.20analysis.20for.20Julia","text":"here"},{"type":"text","text":" , prompted by this discourse "},{"type":"link","url":"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/are-there-julia-operational-semantics-available/52923/4","text":"post"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1610067789.016300","reply_count":1,"reply_users_count":1,"latest_reply":"1610090326.020200","reply_users":["UF4N4QX71"],"subscribed":false,"reactions":[{"name":"+1","users":["UGU761DU2","UF4N4QX71","U7HAYKY9X","UDSU53PEG"],"count":4}]},{"client_msg_id":"5d3d402d-7cc5-4588-bba8-83abf8644d78","type":"message","text":"Thanks for tracking the thread!","user":"UF4N4QX71","ts":"1610090326.020200","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"RHW","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Thanks for tracking the thread!"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1610067789.016300","parent_user_id":"UDGT4PM41"}]
