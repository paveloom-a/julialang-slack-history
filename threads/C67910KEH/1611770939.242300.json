He also ran a school and enjoyed the support of rulers, and advocated peaceful means of resolving disputes in contrast to the wars which were common in the Warring States period. However, little is known about the particulars of his life, and furthermore many of his writings have been lost. All of his essays — fourteen originally but only six extant — are included in the anthology the Gongsun Longzi (Chinese: 公孫龍子; pinyin: Gōngsūn lóng zi; Wade–Giles: Kung-sun Lung-tzu).\nIn Book 17 of the Zhuangzi anthology, Gongsun thus speaks of himself:\n\nWhen young, I studied the way of the former kings. When I grew up, I understood the practice of kindness and duty. I united the same and different, separated hard from white, made so the not-so and admissible the inadmissible. I confounded the wits of the hundred schools and exhausted the eloquence of countless speakers. I took myself to have reached the ultimate.\nHe is best known for a series of paradoxes in the tradition of Hui Shi, including \"White horses are not horses,\" \"When no thing is not the pointed-out, to point out is not to point out,\" and \"There is no 1 in 2.\" These paradoxes seem to suggest a similarity to the discovery in Greek philosophy that pure logic may lead to apparently absurd conclusions.","fallback":"wikipedia: Gongsun Long","service_icon":"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/unfurl_icons/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongsun_Long"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"33P","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"user","user_id":"U687RKK0E"},{"type":"text","text":" The Dragon Philosopher is also famous for his other essays, like the one imaginatively translated on Wikipedia as \"on pointing at things\" "},{"type":"link","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongsun_Long"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1611770939.242300","parent_user_id":"U687RKK0E"},{"client_msg_id":"de0eb07b-05ef-44be-8f27-923500c21625","type":"message","text":"I mean, if that's not a treatise on referential semantics, I don't know what is","user":"U677NAWV8","ts":"1611778523.251400","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"=v9","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"I mean, if that's not a treatise on referential semantics, I don't know what is"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1611770939.242300","parent_user_id":"U687RKK0E","reactions":[{"name":"+1","users":["U687RKK0E","U68M6ERG8","U66M57AN4"],"count":3},{"name":"joy","users":["U687RKK0E","UGU761DU2","U82LX4ACB","U011LUQ182G","U66M57AN4"],"count":5},{"name":"point_right","users":["U66M57AN4"],"count":1},{"name":"point_left","users":["U66M57AN4"],"count":1},{"name":"point_up_2","users":["U66M57AN4"],"count":1},{"name":"point_down","users":["U66M57AN4"],"count":1}]},{"client_msg_id":"e31f6b23-99a7-41d6-a625-6d943c2ad8e0","type":"message","text":"Time travelling C programmer confirmed?","user":"UH24GRBLL","ts":"1611782466.254300","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"6BUSI","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Time travelling C programmer confirmed?"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1611770939.242300","parent_user_id":"U687RKK0E"},{"client_msg_id":"3838f89b-fe4a-44e4-b230-637b3706cf6a","type":"message","text":"For reference: I found a copy of the White Horse Analect with English translation <https://ctext.org/gongsunlongzi/bai-ma-lun>","user":"U677NAWV8","ts":"1611785790.263400","team":"T68168MUP","attachments":[{"title":"Gongsunlongzi : White Horse Discourse - Chinese Text Project","title_link":"https://ctext.org/gongsunlongzi/bai-ma-lun","text":"White Horse Discourse (白馬論) - full text database, fully browsable and searchable on-line; discussion and list of publications related to White Horse Discourse.
