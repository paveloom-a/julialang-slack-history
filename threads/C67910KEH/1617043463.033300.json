Have you ever wanted to contribute a bug fix? Then this tutorial is for you! I will walk you through getting the community resources (Discourse and Slack) so that you can get help, get the Juno and GitKraken development environments going, and show all of the steps of building a package. In this video you will learn how to use modules, how to interactively update a package without recompiling, how to setup continuous integration testing, and how to get your package registered. In addition, I show how to \"dev\" a package to get a local copy to work on, and use this to give a bug fix to open a pull-request to fix an issue on ...
