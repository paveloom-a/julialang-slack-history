I hope, you'll let me know once it's alive. Great question. Talking about coding is hard without the... you know... code to look into. But when I was listening to podcasts about Python, it helped me a lot. With a lingo, with understanding constraints, etc. So it can be anything like news about Julia, talk with people working in different fields - what are the challenges they face? Diving into the specific aspects, like testing? Packages maybe? Even about the unique aspects of Julia... I'm looking at it from the beginner's perspective.
