This kind of stack is also known as an execution stack, program stack, control stack, run-time stack, or machine stack, and is often shortened to just \"the stack\". Although maintenance of the call stack is important for the proper functioning of most software, the details are normally hidden and automatic in high-level programming languages. Many computer instruction sets provide special instructions for manipulating stacks.\nA call stack is used for several related purposes, but the main reason for having one is to keep track of the point to which each active subroutine should return control when it finishes executing. An active subroutine is one that has been called, but is yet to complete execution, after which control should be handed back to the point of call. Such activations of subroutines may be nested to any level (recursive as a special case), hence the stack structure. For example, if a subroutine DrawSquare calls a subroutine DrawLine from four different places, DrawLine must know where to return when its execution completes. To accomplish this, the address following the instruction that jumps to DrawLine, the return address, is pushed onto the top of the call stack with each call.","fallback":"wikipedia: Call stack","service_icon":"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/unfurl_icons/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#STACK-FRAME"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"HjX","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"I'm learning about stack frames ("},{"type":"link","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#STACK-FRAME"},{"type":"text","text":") and wondering that how they are handled there."}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1610644521.009600","parent_user_id":"UAGBT2X1A"},{"client_msg_id":"a8d126c7-da45-49d9-b90d-5b4530eec069","type":"message","text":"are you trying to learn how julia does stack frames or how stack frames in general work?","user":"UH24GRBLL","ts":"1610645449.012900","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"MLnB","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"are you trying to learn how julia does stack frames or how stack frames in general work?"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1610644521.009600","parent_user_id":"UAGBT2X1A"},{"client_msg_id":"8b204661-9a49-4ccf-8161-0c72a76147ba","type":"message","text":"Are you wondering about calling a function with a literal `Symbol`?
