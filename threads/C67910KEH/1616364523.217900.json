This question was motivated by the undocumented broyden solver in NLsolve.jl. This solver requires the inverse of the jacobian, which is clearly not optimal when it’s sparse. I wouldn’t mind implementing my own if there isn’t, but could anyone point me to the right algorithm either in math or from other languages?
