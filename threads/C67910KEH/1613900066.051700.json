Languages may be classified according to the dominant sequence of these elements in unmarked sentences (i.e., sentences in which an unusual word order is not used for emphasis). The label is often used for ergative languages that do not have subjects, but have an agent–verb–object (AVO) order.  English is included in this group. An example is \"Sam ate oranges.\"\nSVO is the second-most common order by number of known languages, after SOV. Together, SVO and SOV account for more than 75% of the world's languages. It is also the most common order developed in Creole languages, suggesting that it may be somehow more initially \"obvious\" to human psychology.Languages regarded as SVO include: All Bantu languages, Albanian, Arabic dialects, Assyrian, Bosnian, Chinese, English, Estonian, Finnish (but see below), French, Greek, Hausa, Icelandic (with the V2 restriction), Igbo, Italian, Javanese, Khmer, Latvian, Macedonian, Malay (Malaysian, Indonesian), Modern Hebrew, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Quiche, Reo Rapa, Romanian, Russian (but see below), Slovene, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish (with the V2 restriction), Thai and Lao, Ukrainian (but see below), Vietnamese and Yoruba.\nAncient Greek has free syntactic order, though Classical Greeks tended to favor SOV. Many famous phrases are SVO, however.","fallback":"wikipedia: Subject–verb–object","service_icon":"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/unfurl_icons/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"t6f","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_quote","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"I think most natural languages are subject-verb-object.\n"}]},{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"\nWrong.
