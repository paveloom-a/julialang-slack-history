I’m investing my own money into evaluating Julia for serious work. Switching costs are high, often prohibitively so.  Introducing new languages is expensive and carries risk. I’m opening minded about whether Julia will prove successful in our project. You might consider the value of my opinions while I am at the neophyte stage before I become acclimatized to (or hostage to) the trade-offs inherent in the Julia language design."}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1611263434.025000","parent_user_id":"UDB26738Q"},{"client_msg_id":"fb1e411e-15e8-49ce-98d9-78c47faf0dcd","type":"message","text":"The fact remains that on the last moderately sized system we built for designing chemical processing equipment, I could run over 2000 tests consisting of 16000 lines of test code in around 20 seconds (including unit tests, integration tests, many being property-based tests of 200 iterations each) in around 20 seconds.

I agree that it is better to talk to you directly than guessing what you meant.
