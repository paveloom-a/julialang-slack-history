The more important 70% is application form (like style of writing) and CV (important for me: shows that applicant finishs what is started and shows some social life and interests e.g. sports or clubs). A broad life and education experience is more important than a specific special expertism in some special field.\n\nSeeing this thread as the first impression you make as an applicant on me to decide to invite you for an interview it starts with this \"smol floof\". What are you telling me with that? You feel small and cute, you need shelter and protection, you need advice, you are fragile and you need a safe space. When I can give you that, will you be productive and creative? Perhaps, but I can not be sure. To sum it up: employing you needs some significant special effort, but productive outcome is unclear. There are probably other applicants where the risk of underperformance is lower with lower effort to get it started.\n\nI am saying that just because of the \"smol floof\" and because I just have limited time to go through all the applications. Depending on the influx, there are not more than 10-15 interviews in the first phase. For me the \"smol floof\" puts you already on the second choice.\n\nYour further discussion on this subject tells me, that you already made some unfortunate experience with your applications and that you made up your own theory on that, which is quite negative and mostly wrong. And my guess is, that you should change your style of application. Youi should seek some advice on this, perhaps professional advice, on how to improve the impression you make in a way, that isn't just made up and a lie, but focus on your strength and not on your weakness.\n\nIn an application put your strengths in the focus and only talk about them. Never ever put a \"smol floof\" at the front. You don't need to be a shredded pitbull, but how about being a member of the beagle brigade? Cute, friendly and nice but determined! In the interview it will come to your weaknesses, and there you will present a single one. That one you have thought about a lot before and what to tell them, it has to be short and clear, something you are aware of and which is under control. Thats what you show them about it.\n\nThis is just a small and quite general tip for you to improve things and learning to be successful in your own goals, which nearly always needs other people.

The more important 70% is application form (like style of writing) and CV (important for me: shows that applicant finishs what is started and shows some social life and interests e.g. sports or clubs). A broad life and education experience is more important than a specific special expertism in some special field.\n\nSeeing this thread as the first impression you make as an applicant on me to decide to invite you for an interview it starts with this \"smol floof\". What are you telling me with that? You feel small and cute, you need shelter and protection, you need advice, you are fragile and you need a safe space. When I can give you that, will you be productive and creative? Perhaps, but I can not be sure. To sum it up: employing you needs some significant special effort, but productive outcome is unclear. There are probably other applicants where the risk of underperformance is lower with lower effort to get it started.\n\nI am saying that just because of the \"smol floof\" and because I just have limited time to go through all the applications. Depending on the influx, there are not more than 10-15 interviews in the first phase. For me the \"smol floof\" puts you already on the second choice.\n\nYour further discussion on this subject tells me, that you already made some unfortunate experience with your applications and that you made up your own theory on that, which is quite negative and mostly wrong. And my guess is, that you should change your style of application. Youi should seek some advice on this, perhaps professional advice, on how to improve the impression you make in a way, that isn't just made up and a lie, but focus on your strength and not on your weakness.\n\nIn an application put your strengths in the focus and only talk about them. Never ever put a \"smol floof\" at the front. You don't need to be a shredded pitbull, but how about being a member of the beagle brigade? Cute, friendly and nice but determined! In the interview it will come to your weaknesses, and there you will present a single one. That one you have thought about a lot before and what to tell them, it has to be short and clear, something you are aware of and which is under control.
