What's the most \"Julian\" way of doing the following... just getting back into the language after a break.\n\nI want to have a user definable (from a config file) chain of transformations that accepts a datatype of like ten numbers and outputs the transformed version.  I know that I can use `reduce` with the function composition operator to turn everything into one function that's nice and performant.\n\nHowever, my problem is that I don't understand how to make \"parametric functions\".  Basically I want to be able to add a function into the list of transforms that depends on some user configuration.  As an example, I want one which adds normally distributed noise to one field of the input datatype (user selectable) with a programmable mean and standard deviation.  In python I would do this using classes and OOP and have a class `NormallyDistributedNoiseTransform` that has member variables `field`, `mu`, and `sigma` that determines how each instance acts.  Then I would have a list of Transform objects that are chained together.  I'm not sure how to approach this in Julia (performance is also key here since I will be running it like 1e6 times in a monte-carlo thing)  Any hints?","user":"U012MJL8EPN","ts":"1617650456.261800","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"8Kv","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hey!
