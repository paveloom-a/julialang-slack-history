The situation might not be quite as bad as the saying implies, but it is true that we have a lot of different file formats, representing the various kinds of data we work with. For that reason, creating file parsers is a central task in bioinformatics, and has almost become a craft in itself.","fallback":"BioJulia: Tutorial to Automa: Part 1 | BioJulia","thumb_url":"https://BioJulia.github.io/images/logo_huf2e28fc1e802707079b8e0ffee62f4dc_19447_300x300_fit_lanczos_2.png","ts":1598797689,"from_url":"https://biojulia.net/post/automa1/","thumb_width":300,"thumb_height":300,"service_icon":"https://biojulia.net/images/icon_huf2e28fc1e802707079b8e0ffee62f4dc_19447_192x192_fill_lanczos_center_2.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://biojulia.net/post/automa1/"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"BsDz","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Yes, I made a tutorial about it:\n"},{"type":"link","url":"https://biojulia.net/post/automa1/"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1615046268.149500","parent_user_id":"UPUBAM63X","reactions":[{"name":"heart","users":["UPUBAM63X","UPJCQHPC7"],"count":2}]},{"client_msg_id":"85c1712b-5211-4ce3-aa84-fef62230d066","type":"message","text":"Think I'm going to just write it in Rust.
