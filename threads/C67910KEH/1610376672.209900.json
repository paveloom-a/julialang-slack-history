The inability of the support personnel to resolve their real problem or to understand the nature of their inquiry may cause the end user to become frustrated. The situation can make itself clear if the end user asks about some seemingly inane detail which is disconnected from any useful end goal. The solution for the support personnel is to ask probing questions as to why the information is needed, in order to identify the root problem and redirect the end user away from an unproductive path of inquiry.","fallback":"wikipedia: XY problem","service_icon":"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/unfurl_icons/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"5DD","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"I think this is an xy problem ("},{"type":"link","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem"},{"type":"text","text":") what goal are you trying to achieve?"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1610376672.209900","parent_user_id":"U011K6EQAQN"},{"client_msg_id":"5cbe9577-deff-499a-98d1-4cae189ee08b","type":"message","text":"sorry, my English is very poor, hhhhh\n:joy:","user":"U011K6EQAQN","ts":"1610377660.212400","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"0HP","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"sorry, my English is very poor, hhhhh\n"},{"type":"emoji","name":"joy"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1610376672.209900","parent_user_id":"U011K6EQAQN"},{"client_msg_id":"59ee8a83-18f0-4e8b-bdfb-e0776691e3f8","type":"message","text":"what inputs and outputs do you want?","user":"U0179G7FG4F","ts":"1610377686.212600","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"QnY","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"what inputs and outputs do you want?"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1610376672.209900","parent_user_id":"U011K6EQAQN"}]
