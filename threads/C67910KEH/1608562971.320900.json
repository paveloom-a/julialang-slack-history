RustFFT is a high-performance FFT library written in pure Rust. Version 5.0.0-experimental.1 implements AVX acceleration and is 5x-10x faster than RustFFT 4.0.0 at every FFT size. More notably, with this release, RustFFT beats FFTW in performance, one of the industry-leading FFT libraries! To make the comparison, I used the Fourier crate's very useful benchmarks, which compare the performance of RustFFT, Fourier, and FFTW.
