I've been working on a Julia open-source library in the materials domain for about a year now as part of my Master's project, and I'm quite keen on continuing Julia development as part of JSoc this year. I've narrowed down a few of the listed projects that I want to apply for, but before that I express my interests in those, I had a few general questions about projects themselves!\n\n1. Is it necessary to have some working experience with the library that the JSoc project is based on before applying? \n2. Some projects say they need reasonable experience of Julia from the applicant - what might be the best way to judge if you have that? \nAny inputs here appreciated!","user":"U01RXV637C2","ts":"1616249464.058000","team":"T68168MUP","edited":{"user":"U01RXV637C2","ts":"1616249507.000000"},"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"qG=","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hello all!
