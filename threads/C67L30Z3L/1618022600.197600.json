Reading your proposal I don't see clear examples that show you can integrate with existing open source software work. Things like, do you know git well enough to rebase and understand concurrent code changes, can you quickly get up to speed with a large library, how do you write unit tests, etc. This aspect is something that is missing. The best thing you could add to reflect this property would be a section where you link to recent pull requests to standard libraries, even if it's just things like JuliaLang/julia or PyCall.jl, that demonstrate this ability. If you don't have that, find something else that makes this point. Otherwise it is an open question, and every open question is an uncertainty.
