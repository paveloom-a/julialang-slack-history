My lab works on computational structural biology, and my research topic is fast structural alignment of proteins with hashing methods.

Two of those classes are taught with purely Julia, using the Deep Learning package Knet.jl by Deniz Yuret himself.\nThis summer I would like to participate one of the available projects, I checked some of the projects and there are several interesting ones. What should I do further this point? I would like to participate one of the Reinforcement Learning or Deep Learning projects, or if you are open to it; I would also consider something about BioJulia.jl too.\n\nEven writing to the community is exciting for me, I hope we can improve ourselves while developing something beneficial to this great community too!","user":"U01RNRRAQKW","ts":"1616322356.064300","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"wPj","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hello, I'm Emre.
