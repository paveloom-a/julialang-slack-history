My name is Marcello Politi and I am a final year Master student in Computer Science at the University of Tor Vergata in Rome, Italy. I have a strong passion for AI and Space technology. I have lately ended a 6 months internship at the European Space Agency and now I am currently enrolled as a research trainee at INRIA (Sophia-Antipolis Campus) where I am deepening my knowledge about Neural Network Pruning using Julia. I've seen some very interesting projects, but the ones which captured my attention were Scheduling algorithms for Distributed algorithms and some concerning Flux library. Could you give me some advice on how to prepare a strong application for those projects? \n\nI consider this experience very exciting and a great opportunity to boost our skills!","user":"U01FTFACYJ0","ts":"1617040821.094700","team":"T68168MUP","edited":{"user":"U01FTFACYJ0","ts":"1617052204.000000"},"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"QcJ/X","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hello everyone!
