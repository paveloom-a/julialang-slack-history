This project can go in different directions. You can work on developing MultistartOptimization.jl, e.g. adding parallelism, different sampling algorithms, connecting it to Nonconvex.jl. You can work on HyperOpt.jl to develop the algorithm referenced in <https://github.com/baggepinnen/Hyperopt.jl/issues/6>. You can address some other issues there, implement Sobol sequence sampling and TikTak from MultistartOptimization.jl into HyperOpt.jl, connect it to GalacticOptim.jl or Nonconvex.jl. You can find another algorithm that’s not available in either of these packages and implement them. You can use MultistartOptimization.jl and/or HyperOpt.jl with Turing.jl for optimising Bayesian inference algorithms. There are many possibilities. A strong application would have a few PRs to prove your Julia experience and a detailed project proposal showing you have studied the project requirements and packages you will be developing and have done your homework.","user":"U85JBUGGP","ts":"1616879067.081000","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"GDy","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hi "},{"type":"user","user_id":"U01KF8TJEN4"},{"type":"text","text":", I will be co-mentoring this project with Chris.
