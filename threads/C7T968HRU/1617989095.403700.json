So a lot of these methods use PDEs to either denoise an image or to segment the image using combinations of mean curvature flow by level set methods, etc. I was wondering if within the Julia ecosystem, we have any packages with these types of tools? It is kinda a specialized area, so I was not sure where to look. I can probably use MTK as the unifying framework, but then I was not sure if there are any libraries for level set methods or solvers in Julia?","user":"UDDSTBX19","ts":"1617989095.403700","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"Pbyz","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hey folks.
