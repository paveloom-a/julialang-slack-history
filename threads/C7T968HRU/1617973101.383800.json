(see <https://github.com/simsurace/FeedbackParticleFilters.jl>). Currently the package uses its own solver, which is quite naive, not easily customizable, and (probably) much slower than it could be. I would like to use DifferentialEquations.jl as a backend for my package in order to make use of state-of-the-art solvers. The challenge I'm facing is that for particle filtering, one needs to basically set up an SDEProblem that consists of hidden state SDE dX = ..., observation SDE dY = ...,  and a system of SDEs for the particle system, which uses the differential dY as a noise source. In addition, the SDE for the particle filter, at least for the Feedback Particle Filter, is naturally expressed as a Stratonovich SDE, i.e. the term K(t)\\circ dY that appears in the SDEs for the particle system, is a Stratonovich term, whereas the remaining terms are Ito terms. I would like to ask whether there is anyone willing to help out writing this interface. Once the basics are established, this could be reused in a much more general package for continuous time filtering. The composability of DifferentialEquations.jl with machine learning packages open up and endless array of possibilities that will be very valuable for researchers in this domain.","user":"U01RZAE2CV6","ts":"1617973101.383800","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"oPKo","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hi all, l'm developing a package for feedback particle filters, a specific algorithm for online state estimation in continuous-time models, especially models where the hidden state and observation processes are solutions to SDEs.

The filter is defined by an ensemble of controlled stochastic systems (the particles). Each particle evolves under feedback control based on its own state, and features of the empirical distribution of the ensemble. The feedback control law is obtained as the solution to an optimal control problem, in which the optimization criterion is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the actual posterior, and the common posterior of any particle. The following conclusions are obtained for diffusions with continuous observations: 1) The optimal control solution is exact: The two posteriors match exactly, provided they are initialized with identical priors. 2) The optimal filter admits an innovation error-based gain feedback structure. 3) The optimal feedback gain is obtained via a solution of an Euler-Lagrange boundary value problem; the feedback gain equals the Kalman gain in the linear Gaussian case. Numerical algorithms are introduced and implemented in two general examples, and a neuroscience application involving coupled oscillators. In some cases it is found that the filter exhibits significantly lower variance when compared to the bootstrap particle filter.","fallback":"Feedback Particle Filter","thumb_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/assets/img/ieee_logo_smedia_200X200.png","from_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6530707","thumb_width":200,"thumb_height":200,"service_icon":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/favicon.ico","service_name":"ieeexplore.ieee.org","id":1,"original_url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6530707"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"z0t","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"user","user_id":"U01TU3MV8PK"},{"type":"text","text":" Have a look at "},{"type":"link","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6530707"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1617973101.383800","parent_user_id":"U01RZAE2CV6"},{"client_msg_id":"ad46eead-899d-414e-8c15-505e6ad69563","type":"message","text":"cheers!","user":"U01TU3MV8PK","ts":"1617973528.385200","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"ppGbU","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"cheers!"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1617973101.383800","parent_user_id":"U01RZAE2CV6"},{"client_msg_id":"03566a87-3651-4d64-9818-a1c0fe24b850","type":"message","text":"<@U69BL50BF> Thanks and thanks for the tip.
