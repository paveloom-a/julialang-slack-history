I will go from start to finish, describing how to use the type-genericness of the DifferentialEquations.jl library in order to write a code that uses within-method GPU-parallelism on the system of PDEs. This is mostly a proof of concept: the most efficient integrators for this problem are not compatible with GPU parallelism yet, and the GPU parallelism isn't fully efficient yet. However, I thought it would be nice to show an early progress report showing that it works and what needs to be fixed in Base Julia and various libraries for us to get the full efficiency. Edit May 2019 As of DifferentialEquations.jl v6.4.0, this is no longer a proof of concept. The whole library, including implicit solvers with GMRES, etc., and ...
