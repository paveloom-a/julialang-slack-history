I had a couple of questions/things I wanted to say. This slack channel seemed like the best fit(?):\n1. The package implements ‘regional’ sensitivity analysis for differentiable models by solving a differential equation on the model parameters, the trajectory of which conforms to parameter sets that closely fit the data (i.e. have a low cost, for some user-defined cost function). *Open-ended question*: I’m not an expert Julia coder, and I have a full-time job that is orthogonal to this package, so if anybody had any pointers on how the codebase could be improved/extended/merged, I’d be really happy to hear about them. \n2. Would it be possible/reasonable to fit the package within the SciML ecosystem? The algorithm may not be battle-tested enough to do so (although I’ve put a few examples [here](<https://github.com/Dhruva2/MDCExamples>). Certainly it could be improved by people with expertise in numerical analysis. Nevertheless, the goals of the package fit well within those of the SciML organisation, as I see it.\nThanks!","user":"U01GJHBBR7E","ts":"1615572797.084300","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"NAiD","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hi all, I recently made a package ("},{"type":"link","url":"https://dhruva2.github.io/MinimallyDisruptiveCurves.docs/"},{"type":"text","text":") that’s in the process of being registered.
