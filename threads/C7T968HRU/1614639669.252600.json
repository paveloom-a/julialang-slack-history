I have a question about the paper \"Bayesian Neural Ordinary Differential Equations\" (also had a Reddit post a while ago).

Does a GPU help with this kind of small datasets and very shallow neural network architectures. I'm currently running the code from the GitHub repo provided by the paper but the compute times also for these pretty standard experiments are very long.","user":"U018YSX96LB","ts":"1614639669.252600","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"9a2pB","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hi.
