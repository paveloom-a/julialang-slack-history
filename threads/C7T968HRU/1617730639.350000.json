The package implements a recent algorithm for regional sensitivity analysis of models with many parameters. Any models, as long as there is a differentiable cost function. The post on the package announcement board is here The user guide, which contains motivation, examples, and jupyter notebooks, is here It relies heavily on the amazing DifferentialEquations.jl ecosystem, so thanks to all who contributed to that!
