Let me ask some questions:\n - Do you want the renderer to be differentiable or not?\n - Do you want to pre render some frames offline and use them to in training or do you want the network to be trained while it's interacting with the environment?\n - Are you familiar with GPU programming?\n - Are you more CPU or GPU constrained?\n - Do the objects have to be 3d or would 2d shapes always visible for the player also be sufficient?\n - How many frames per second do you expect your network to eat?\n - What resolution will your network eat?\n\nMy general recommendation would be to write stand alone render code (rendering into an buffer) and tie that up with game logic. You can later use this bundle from your  training loop or take something like GameZero, throw your buffer to the screen and record input from the player. I would go with fixed time steps. As for how to accomplish this graphics style, it is awfully simiöar to Wolfenstein3d, here is a video with the ideas how to implement it <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOCQfxRQ2pY>\n\nOh yeah a straightforward math implemenation should be good enough on modern processors","user":"U9MD78Z9N","ts":"1617912516.017200","thread_ts":"1617910640.016900","root":{"client_msg_id":"db9c79d6-c647-42ec-a4ee-c77ea92ad623","type":"message","text":"If I were to make a 3d navigation game, something like <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M40rN7afngY> , how should I begin?
