However, they are typically irrelevant for the description of symmetry-broken states. Here, the authors propose a variant of the spin-fermion model, which exhibits a novel thermodynamically stable phase dubbed the ``Instanton Crystal.'' The intriguing feature of this phase is the configuration of the order parameter consisting precisely of an alternating chain of instantons and anti-instantons. Another interesting feature is a first-order phase transition between the instanton crystal phase and the normal symmetry-broken phase, characterized by a stationary order parameter.","fallback":"Physical Review B: Phase transition into an instanton crystal state","thumb_url":"https://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRB/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevB.103.075121.png","ts":1612857600,"from_url":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.103.075121","thumb_width":200,"thumb_height":200,"id":1,"original_url":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.103.075121"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"TbiJ","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Any APS memebers who can send me "},{"type":"link","url":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.103.075121"},{"type":"text","text":" ?
