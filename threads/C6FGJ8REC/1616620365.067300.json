That's me getting metaphorically hit in the face and then hearing I should not speak out because the punch wasn't directed at me, I just happened to be in the way. It's all fine to put up a politics ban, but that doesn't help those of us whose very existence has been deemed political by others.\nI'm not saying the politics ban should go. I'm in another community with a \"no cross no crown\" policy and it's one of the best places I've been and I've been there for the last 25 years. But you can still have such a ban and allow people to speak out against prejudice, even if they're not personally victim of it.\nFinally, if you are serious about diversity, then you have no choice but calling some opinions out.
