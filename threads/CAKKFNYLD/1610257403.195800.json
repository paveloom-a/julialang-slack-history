I have one quick style question for you all. In hail you can read in a vcf file into a MatrixTable, let’s call it mt, and then print out information about it with `mt.describe`, `mt.show`, and so on. Those functions all work fine on the PyObject in PyCall, but I was thinking it might be better style to wrap them in function to make them more Julia-like. For example, PyHail.describe(mt).
