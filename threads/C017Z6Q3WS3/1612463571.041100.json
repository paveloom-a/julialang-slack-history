The error presented itself as an MCMCChain error instead of a pluto error. I was just wondering if this was a known thing or if I should open a new issue. I did not want to add redundant issues if I can avoid it.","user":"UDDSTBX19","ts":"1612463571.041100","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"DbEy","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hey folks.
