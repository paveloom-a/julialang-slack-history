Whereas plumcots and apriplums are first-generation hybrids between a plum parent (P. salicina or P. cerasifera or their hybrids) and an apricot (P. armeniaca), pluots and apriums are later-generations. Both names \"plumcot\" and \"apriplum\" have been used for trees derived from a plum seed parent, and are therefore equivalent.","fallback":"wikipedia: Pluot","service_icon":"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/unfurl_icons/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluot"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"5FORR","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Made me think about pluots!
