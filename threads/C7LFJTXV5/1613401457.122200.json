So is there a good tutorial or example for using a function instead of the `chain` call. I am new to flux, so I was doing the 60 minute blitz, and that is very helpful. But then I compared that to the model zoo phoneme's example, and that example was a bit too advanced--meaning that there are a lot of syntax calls that I was not sure how to interpret; for example `vcat.(forward.(tokens), flip(backward, tokens))`. What is the next tutorial to look at after the 60 minute blitz, or is there any prescribed sequence for going through the model zoo examples. Like I said, the challenge is just understanding some of the syntactic manipulations, more than anything else.","user":"UDDSTBX19","ts":"1613401457.122200","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"Tiam6","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"user","user_id":"UC4QQPG4A"},{"type":"text","text":" Oh that is good.
