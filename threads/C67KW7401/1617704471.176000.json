Energy transfer in natural photosynthetic complexes is extremely efficient, but it’s not clear how such efficient energy transfer occurs. Quantum effects could potentially be playing an important role, but this remains a controversial area. An international collaboration led by Gui-Lu Long from Tsinghua University, Beijing National Research Center on Information Science and Technology and the Innovation Center of Quantum Matter now provide a proof-of-principle experiment showing that photosynthetic energy transfer can be simulated using quantum computers. Quantum simulations of this type should enable deeper investigations into the role of quantum effects in photosynthetic light harvesting, which could guide the design of artificial light harvesting devices.","fallback":"npj Quantum Information: Efficient quantum simulation of photosynthetic light harvesting","thumb_url":"https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41534-018-0102-2/MediaObjects/41534_2018_102_Fig1_HTML.png","from_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-018-0102-2","thumb_width":685,"thumb_height":233,"id":1,"original_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-018-0102-2"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"Phx","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Yes, but the process is a semi-classical minimization: "},{"type":"link","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-018-0102-2"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1617704471.176000","parent_user_id":"U69BL50BF"},{"client_msg_id":"9203de75-655f-4c61-8d45-7e15312b64a1","type":"message","text":"Unless you're in the camp that it's not quantum at all, which has some good evidence building up <https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/8/eabc4631>","user":"U69BL50BF","ts":"1617706604.200600","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"bpUnH","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Unless you're in the camp that it's not quantum at all, which has some good evidence building up "},{"type":"link","url":"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/8/eabc4631"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1617704471.176000","parent_user_id":"U69BL50BF"},{"client_msg_id":"A0F2D4B1-C6A6-406B-9FC0-6F2DAAB17B1F","type":"message","text":"it is too early to know for sure but i’m still betting quantum weirdness is involved.
