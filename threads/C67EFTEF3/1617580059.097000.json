I am currently working through a package that provides its own Manifest and Project files.

When I do `add Gnuplot`  in the package environment, it seems to update all of the dependencies. My workaround right now is to install the latest version of Gnuplot in the global `v1.6` environment, and so when `using Gnuplot`  even if the package env is activated, would pull the package in from the `v1.6` env.\n\nBut this seems hacky. Is there a more systematic way of doing it?","user":"U6Z8377N2","ts":"1617580059.097000","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"I4A","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Just a question about order of how packages are pulled.
