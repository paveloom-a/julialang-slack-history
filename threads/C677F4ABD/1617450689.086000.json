In particular, an eigenvalue decomposition of the form `A = Q * D * Q^-1` doesn’t always exist for every matrix `A`. The decomposition does not exist when the eigenspace associated with 1 or more of the eigenvalues is degenerate. In other words, the algebraic multiplicity (from the characteristic polynomial `det(A - λ I) = 0`) of an eigenvalue can be greater than 1 but the eigenspace associated with it can still be a vector, not a plane or a higher dimensional subspace. More generally, if the algebraic multiplicity is greater than the geometric multiplicity for any eigenvalue, the decomposition above doesn’t exist. So you can think of `Q` in this case not as a square matrix but a rectangular one, hence it is not invertible. In Julia, you always get a square matrix but with dependent columns so it is still not invertible.\n```julia&gt; A = [1 1 1;\n            0 1 1;\n            0 0 1];\n\njulia&gt; eigen(A).vectors\n3×3 Matrix{Float64}:\n 1.0  -1.0           1.0\n 0.0   2.22045e-16  -2.22045e-16\n 0.0   0.0           4.93038e-32```\nIn this particular case, the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue `λ = 1` is 3 but the geometric multiplicity (i.e. dimension of the eigenspace associated) is only 1 as can be seen above. The eigenspace is simply the x-axis. Interestingly, the SVD doesn’t have this issue and the left and right singular vectors are always independent and orthonormal as to be expected.
