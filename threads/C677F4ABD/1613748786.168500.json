The Schur complement is a key tool in the fields of numerical analysis, statistics, and matrix analysis.","fallback":"wikipedia: Schur complement","service_icon":"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/unfurl_icons/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur_complement"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"sq6","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"I've never used BlockArrays.jl, so I have no idea what's in there.
