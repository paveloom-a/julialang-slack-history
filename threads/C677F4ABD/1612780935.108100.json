To achive this, I’m first cal sparse(row, col, data) to get the matrix to the appropriate form. Although the matrices I’m working on are large, N should be representable with UInt32, i.e., smaller than 2^32, so this is what I’m using as the type of row and col to save some memory. So far so good - but I get problems when the number of entries in my matrix is larger than 2^32. In this case I get an error sa...","fallback":"JuliaLang: Index type of sparse matrix","thumb_url":"https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business5/uploads/julialang/original/2X/1/12829a7ba92b924d4ce81099cbf99785bee9b405.png","ts":1612770578,"from_url":"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/index-type-of-sparse-matrix/54828","thumb_width":408,"thumb_height":263,"service_icon":"https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business5/uploads/julialang/optimized/2X/6/6ca888e296f59ca2a599807f7d5edd489e3d1829_2_180x180.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/index-type-of-sparse-matrix/54828"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"oqJ","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Would be great if someone with "},{"type":"text","text":"SparseMatrixCSC","style":{"code":true}},{"type":"text","text":" knowledge can shine some light onto "},{"type":"link","url":"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/index-type-of-sparse-matrix/54828"},{"type":"text","text":"."}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1612780935.108100","reply_count":6,"reply_users_count":2,"latest_reply":"1612782032.110000","reply_users":["U6N6VQE30","U67SCG4HG"],"subscribed":false},{"client_msg_id":"049f918d-1357-4897-8a70-676edffca985","type":"message","text":"What kinda of reply would you expect?
