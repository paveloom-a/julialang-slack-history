Definitely a beautiful plot in that post. Sounds like it would be a bit manual to get it drawn - at least in this case, I will eventually need to port the analysis to JS to embed on a webpage, and was hoping there might be pre-built solution to get an example while sticking to Julia. If not, I think I might hop over to JS to do the low-level plotting from the start.\n\nThanks for the suggestion, though!
