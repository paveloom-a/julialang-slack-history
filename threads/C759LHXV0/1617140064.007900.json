Definitely a beautiful plot in that post. Sounds like it would be a bit manual to get it drawn - at least in this case, I will eventually need to port the analysis to JS to embed on a webpage, and was hoping there might be pre-built solution to get an example while sticking to Julia. If not, I think I might hop over to JS to do the low-level plotting from the start.\n\nThanks for the suggestion, though! If I had more time I would love to build out a function in Julia - maybe after I got a handle on the plot construct I can build a recipe.","user":"UP0P065ME","ts":"1617141997.008400","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"Wmui","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Thanks "},{"type":"user","user_id":"US64J0NPQ"},{"type":"text","text":"!
