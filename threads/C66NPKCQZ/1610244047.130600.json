I would read it as \"the probability of Y given X in the presence of K\". Does that make sense? And in this case, if K is an environmental variable, how do I mathematically incorporate the variable into, for example, Bayes' Theorem? I could be completely wrong but I appreciate any pointers to get me back on track. :slightly_smiling_face:","user":"US64J0NPQ","ts":"1610244047.130600","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"I65Fc","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hey, how do you read this probability: "},{"type":"text","text":"P(Y | X, K = k)","style":{"code":true}},{"type":"text","text":" where "},{"type":"text","text":"K","style":{"code":true}},{"type":"text","text":" is an environmental variable?
