However, I find that in the julia repl--at least in emacs, I can only go back 1 command. I think this might be a julia repl setting, since in other emacs shells my history goes back farther. Can anyone confirm this, or tell me what setting to change to increase the history buffer?","user":"UDDSTBX19","ts":"1613836826.003100","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"s42P2","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hey emacians, I was using the julia repl to evaluate code in emacs, which works just fine.
