However, when I load back the file, the type of data changes to `Array{Any, 1}` . For now I resolved this by repackaging the array with `data = [data...]`  when loading from file, which gives the data the expected type `Array{MyStruct, 1}` . What's the proper way to address this?","user":"UTMTRHLHY","ts":"1610033720.352100","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"mT4zj","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hello, I think I might be using the bson format in Julia incorrectly but I am not sure how to do it properly:  I save my data structured as "},{"type":"text","text":"Dict(:data=>data::Array{MyStruct, 1})","style":{"code":true}},{"type":"text","text":"  into "},{"type":"text","text":".bson","style":{"code":true}},{"type":"text","text":"  file.
