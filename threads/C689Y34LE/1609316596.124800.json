[{"client_msg_id":"defccd65-9e93-4c2f-b405-238305991f94","type":"message","text":"I have a C program that uses CuFFT to perform long FFts on 8 bit (signed integer) data samples.  CuFFT doesn't support 8 bit integers natively, but to conserve GPU memory the program uses CuFFT callbacks to feed it normalized floats that are read though a texture memory object backed by an input buffer containing the 8-bit samples.  This texture memory object is setup using the \"CUDA Runtime API\" `cudaTextureDesc` structure, which has a `readMode` field that can be set to `cudaReadModeNormalizedFloat` to get a \"free\" on-the-fly conversion from 8 bit signed integer to normalized float, `[-1, +1]`.\n\nI'd like to replicate this functionality with CUDA.jl, but I've encountered several roadblocks:\n\n1. CUDA.jl uses the \"CUDA Driver API\" and the texture object setup is different enough that there is no distinct equivalent to  `readMode=cudaReadModeNormalizedFloat`.  The CUDA docs are not too clear on this, but it seems like maybe just leaving out the `CU_TRSF_READ_AS_INTEGER` flag might suffice?  Currently that flag is always set if an integer type is backing the texture object, but that could be made selectable with a new keyword argument (with backward compatible default value) to the `CuTexture` constructor.\n2. Even if that does enable the equivalent behavior in the texture object, it seems that CUDA.jl texture fetches always returns integer values if the data type backing the texture object is of an integer type.  This precludes any use of the texture memory for this free int-to-float conversion, but it's not clear to me how to make it possible to selectively enable/disable this aspect of CUDA.jl's texture fetch functionality.\n3. The `cufftXtSetCallback()` function is not exposed by CUDA.jl.  This would be easy enough to add, but it's not clear how one could create the callback functions and get pointers to them.  Maybe via `CUDA.dynamic_cufunction`?\n4. Given the above items, I'm contemplating taking the memory hit and expanding the input data to 32 (or 16?) bit floats.  Has anyone used the (not yet wrapped) NPP functions?  They seem fairly straightforward to use via `ccall()`, but I wonder whether they offer enough added performance over CUDA.jl conversion functions to be worth the extra calling effort.\nThanks for any feedback!","user":"U01FKQQ7J0J","ts":"1609316596.124800","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"aXQ5","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"I have a C program that uses CuFFT to perform long FFts on 8 bit (signed integer) data samples.
