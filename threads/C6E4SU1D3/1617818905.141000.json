Vega-Lite provides a higher-level grammar for visual analysis, comparable to ggplot or Tableau, that generates complete Vega specifications. Vega-Lite specifications consist of simple mappings of variables in a data set to visual encoding channels such as x, y, color, and size. These mappings are then translated into detailed visualization specifications in the form of Vega specification language. Vega-Lite produces default values for visualization components (e.g., scales, axes, and legends) in the output Vega specification using a rule-based approach, but users can explicit specify these properties to override default values.","fallback":"Vega-Lite: Legend","from_url":"https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/legend.html","service_icon":"https://vega.github.io/favicon.ico","id":1,"original_url":"https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/legend.html"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"0kK","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"it should be possible with the "},{"type":"text","text":"legend","style":{"code":true}},{"type":"text","text":" encoding "},{"type":"link","url":"https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/legend.html"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1617818905.141000","parent_user_id":"U013V2CFZAN"},{"client_msg_id":"d78dd357-b66b-46c5-a696-6b7faee019b0","type":"message","text":"that's the part that I am struggling with","user":"U013V2CFZAN","ts":"1617820846.141400","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"ab5","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"that's the part that I am struggling with"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1617818905.141000","parent_user_id":"U013V2CFZAN"},{"client_msg_id":"d8b493be-7631-4ac1-80c7-adfe90e3bc1d","type":"message","text":"I put it in the \"encode\" section, but nothing seems to happen","user":"U013V2CFZAN","ts":"1617820862.141600","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"aUM","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"I put it in the \"encode\" section, but nothing seems to happen"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1617818905.141000","parent_user_id":"U013V2CFZAN"},{"client_msg_id":"3cc552a8-aa68-4a5e-9533-9fe93c9a0c7c","type":"message","text":"actually, I realized that what I want are labels inside of the arcs","user":"U013V2CFZAN","ts":"1617820906.141800","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"tFr","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"actually, I realized that what I want are labels inside of the arcs"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1617818905.141000","parent_user_id":"U013V2CFZAN"}]
