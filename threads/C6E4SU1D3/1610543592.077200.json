It graphically depicts the ratios of the three variables as positions in an equilateral triangle. It is used in physical chemistry, petrology, mineralogy, metallurgy, and other physical sciences to show the compositions of systems composed of three species. In population genetics, it is often called a de Finetti diagram. In game theory, it is often called a simplex plot. Ternary plots are tools for analyzing compositional data in the three-dimensional case.\n\nIn a ternary plot, the values of the three variables a, b, and c must sum to some constant, K. Usually, this constant is represented as 1.0 or 100%. Because a + b + c = K for all substances being graphed, any one variable is not independent of the others, so only two variables must be known to find a sample's point on the graph: for instance, c must be equal to K − a − b. Because the three numerical values cannot vary independently—there are only two degrees of freedom—it is possible to graph the combinations of all three variables in only two dimensions.","fallback":"wikipedia: Ternary plot","service_icon":"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/unfurl_icons/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_plot"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"8u0B","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Unfortunately I can’t help you, but this ternary plot is very cool.
