[{"type":"message","text":"Making a 3d scatter plot using Pluto and Plots + Plotly and am not having any success filling the colors based on a fourth value. Everything is stored in a DataFrame with a column of Float64 for each:\n• target_x\n• target_y\n• target_z\n• Pressure (values range from about 100 to 1000)\n```scatter(df.target_x, df.target_y, df.target_z, fill_z = slab_blast_df.Pressure)```\nbut no matter what I try all of the points take the same color. I've noticed that if I provide a vector of color symbols [:red, :green, :blue ... etc.] the points take those colors in repeating order, which has led me to try to explicitly convert the Pressure vector to one of color symbols, but this seems like working harder and not smarter as I have not had this problem before using gr() backend.\n\nAny suggestions?
