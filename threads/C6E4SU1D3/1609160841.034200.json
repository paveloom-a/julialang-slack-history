By real-time I mean, at a 125Hz frequency as the values arrive. I’m working with Makie and concluded to this code based on this issue. I will just comment the above code: I got the values over TCP as a string in a format of \"[1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5, 6.6]\\n\". Then I update a string Node to process it with readdlm().
