I’ve bumping up against this again as I try to separate out a metrics package from MLJBase because metrics share a bunch of traits with models (for example `prediction_type` - probabilistic or deterministic). The new StatisticalMeasures package ought not to depend on any of our machine learning model code, but without introducing a third package for the trait stubs I’m stuck.
