Due to only have 1 observation/patient, I am looking into the z-score, i.e. calculating that patient z-score based on healthy stats, to check how much it deviates to healthy central tendency and how significant it is (by converting it to p-value).\n\nMy questions:\n1. Can this approach be called a 'one-sample z-test'? I have been reading around and most of the example I found, the 'one-sample' refers to another sample population, not 1 observation.\n2. My follow-up question would be, is it valid to do multiple comparison correction, such as Bonferroni-Holm on top of this analysis?\nI have been browsing about this but could not find any information for this specific question. Any help would be greatly appreciated!","user":"UUT4VGTE2","ts":"1616730322.036500","team":"T68168MUP","edited":{"user":"UUT4VGTE2","ts":"1616730379.000000"},"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"DRZ2X","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"I have a basic stats question.
