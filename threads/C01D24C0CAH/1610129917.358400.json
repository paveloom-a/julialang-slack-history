Not sure fi that is the case here?  In this case, the PE is the integral of g \\rho z over the volume.  Using the evolution equation for the buoyancy, and some algebra, I believe you can find that the APE is equal to something proportional to \\rho'^2.  It would be nice to do this for general stratifications but that would be harder.
