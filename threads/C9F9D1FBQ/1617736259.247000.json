So far just the format support seems a bit hard (Would like to load EXRs now, could also see geometry formats being a bit of a pain). Going to be looking into a bit of convolution training, which Python has better library support for, but Flux.jl looks useful, and my hope is it being a bit more minimal will be useful, as any models I build I'll likely have to manually convert to be useful for a game. Pretty interested in using Julia's metaprogramming/AST support to try to generate material/shader code. The big challenge is just the huge library support for Python, especially in VFX, an industry adjacent to games as related to rendering.","user":"U01T0B2F03H","ts":"1617744842.253800","team":"T68168MUP","thread_ts":"1617736259.247000","parent_user_id":"U01T0B2F03H"}]
