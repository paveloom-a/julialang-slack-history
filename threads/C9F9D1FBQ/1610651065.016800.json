I am Manas Gupta and am an undergrad and have been fascinated by machines and programs that have the ability to make smart decisions, since I was a child. I find Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning and math very interesting especially Linear algebra, Probability, Differential equations, Multivariable calculus. Oh and I love physics as well. I would love to get my hands dirty while trying out crazy new ideas that pop up in the AI community.  Also thinking about applying to gsoc to have a memorable summer this year and get a good experience with open source. Really looking forward to get to know everyone, contribute to the community and learn new things along with you all. :simple_smile:","user":"U01KF8TJEN4","ts":"1610651065.016800","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"bPe","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hi everyone!
