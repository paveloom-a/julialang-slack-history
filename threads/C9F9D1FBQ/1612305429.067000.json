I accidently sent the previous message before it was finished.  First, thanks for all the great YouTube videos you have created.  They are a gold mine of information!    Also, I am working with the Process Engineering group at AstraZeneca (in Gaithersburg, MD) and I am proposing to  them that PINNs implemented with Julia is what they need to use for some of the problems they are addressing.  I think the existence of a very supportive Julia community will be important to them when they decide what to do.  I have created an example PINNs application (in Julia) for them in the area of process scale chromatography (an area they are interested in) so they can see what PINNs can do in an area of interest to them.  Of course, I am a novice myself in this area so I can use all the help I can  get!  I would be interested in getting from you any interesting new examples of PINNs (especially how to speed up the convergence process, which can be painfully slow at times).","user":"U01LK68LHJS","ts":"1612363172.075300","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"Dqk","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hi again Chris.
