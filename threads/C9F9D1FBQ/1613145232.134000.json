I've been coming up to speed on Julia for the past several months and developing code for PDE-constrained optimization (\"inverse design\") of waveguides for short laser pulses. Migrating from using python to control compiled PDE solver libraries has been surprisingly approachable thanks to all of the great ongoing work in the Julia community and is already proving useful for my research. I am excited to join and hopefully contribute to the ecosystem.\nI am currently focused on automatic differentiation applied to eigenmode solutions of parameterized PDEs (just the Helmholtz equation for now), Other relevant buzzwords include \"adjoint method\" and \"matrix-free\"/\"implicit\" operators. Please feel free to reach out if you have overlapping interests and would like to chat. I look forward to learning from/with you all.","user":"U01HK5WRVJT","ts":"1613145232.134000","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"fGy","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hello everyone,\nI'm Dodd (he/him), a postdoc working on a mix of topics in nonlinear optics, integrated photonics and Raman spectroscopy in the EECS dept. at MIT.
