It is similar to the proprietary programs Origin or SigmaPlot.\nQtiPlot can be used to present 2D and 3D data and has various data analysis functions like curve fitting. Plotting of 3D data can be rendered using OpenGL using the Qwt3D libraries.\nThe program is also extensible to a considerable degree via muParser and Python scripting language, which allows adding the arbitrary user-defined functions with access to graphs, matrices and data tables.\nOlder QtiPlot versions up to 0.9.8.9 were released under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) and are available also as binaries for Linux distribution repositories as well as for Windows.Starting with version 0.9.9 the source code is not available from the author anymore. Compiled binaries are available for Microsoft Windows, several Linux distributions and Mac OS X; downloading binaries from the author's website requires purchase of an annual maintenance contract. Files saved by version 0.9.9 cannot be loaded by version 0.9.8.","fallback":"wikipedia: QtiPlot","service_icon":"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/unfurl_icons/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QtiPlot"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"QknFu","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"for those curious, the package was "},{"type":"link","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QtiPlot"},{"type":"text","text":".  they got fed up on linux it was easy to build (it was even in many distros) that in the end they changed the license to proprietary"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1615425511.140600","parent_user_id":"UDB26738Q"},{"client_msg_id":"9d8f4116-0864-48ae-99ef-7c9bcd684756","type":"message","text":"and this is my blogpost, in Italian: <http://elubuntu.blogspot.com/2011/02/compilare-qtiplot-0984.html>","user":"UDB26738Q","ts":"1615425698.144800","team":"T68168MUP","attachments":[{"title":"Compilare QtiPlot 0.9.8.4","title_link":"http://elubuntu.blogspot.com/2011/02/compilare-qtiplot-0984.html","text":"NOTA : Renato Rivoira, che ringrazio, ha curato la traduzione in italiano di QtiPlot e del suo manuale.
