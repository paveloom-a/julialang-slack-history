A non-blocking algorithm is lock-free if there is guaranteed system-wide progress, and wait-free if there is also guaranteed per-thread progress. \"Non-blocking\" was used as a synonym for \"lock-free\" in the literature until the introduction of obstruction-freedom in 2003.The word \"non-blocking\" was traditionally used to describe telecommunications networks that could route a connection through a set of relays \"without having to re-arrange existing calls\", see Clos network. Also, if the telephone exchange \"is not defective, it can always make the connection\", see nonblocking minimal spanning switch.","fallback":"wikipedia: Non-blocking algorithm","service_icon":"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/unfurl_icons/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"WyHYj","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"there's a basic disambiguation at "},{"type":"link","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1612772094.053600","parent_user_id":"UH24GRBLL"},{"client_msg_id":"acac9153-c0ee-471f-8bc7-bc5635e9ceda","type":"message","text":"the concept is not really novel (first explored theoretically in the 80s, as basically all data structures are nowadays) but there has been a few interesting developments in the last 10 years and I thought it'd be interesting to look at a julia implementation for my final bachelors project","user":"UH24GRBLL","ts":"1612775787.055900","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"Kln","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"the concept is not really novel (first explored theoretically in the 80s, as basically all data structures are nowadays) but there has been a few interesting developments in the last 10 years and I thought it'd be interesting to look at a julia implementation for my final bachelors project"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1612772094.053600","parent_user_id":"UH24GRBLL"},{"type":"message","subtype":"thread_broadcast","text":"In particular, I think I'd need atomic references, but Base.Threads only seems to have atomics for isbits number types like Bool, Ints, Floats..","user":"UH24GRBLL","ts":"1612777531.056200","thread_ts":"1612772094.053600","root":{"client_msg_id":"3a29e15e-e1dd-4359-969b-dd310a30fa69","type":"message","text":"Hi everyone!\n\nI'm interested in lock-free and wait-free datastructures, does anyone know about implementations/drafts/challenges/ideas in combination with julia?
