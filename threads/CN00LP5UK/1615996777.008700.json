There have been some attempts to sorta automate some of the manual parsing, but they were still pretty clunky. I really think one of the main reasons MATLAB users tend to write gigantic monolithic functions with almost no code reuse is that there’s so much boilerplate that goes into argument parsing for new functions.\n\nSo apprecigripe to Julia for spoiling me with such nice function argument syntax.
