Specifically, given an algebra A over a ring or a field K, a K-derivation is a K-linear map D : A → A that satisfies Leibniz's law:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        D\n        (\n        a\n        b\n        )\n        =\n        a\n        D\n        (\n        b\n        )\n        +\n        D\n        (\n        a\n        )\n        b\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D(ab)=aD(b)+D(a)b.}\n  More generally, if M is an A-bimodule, a K-linear map D : A → M that satisfies the Leibniz law is also called a derivation.  The collection of all K-derivations of A to itself is denoted by DerK(A).  The collection of K-derivations of A into an A-module M is denoted by DerK(A, M).\nDerivations occur in many different contexts in diverse areas of mathematics.  The partial derivative with respect to a variable is an R-derivation on the algebra of real-valued differentiable functions on Rn.  The Lie derivative with respect to a vector field is an R-derivation on the algebra of differentiable functions on a differentiable manifold; more generally it is a derivation on the tensor algebra of a manifold. It follows that the adjoint representation of a Lie algebra is a derivation on that algebra. The Pincherle derivative is an example of a derivation in abstract algebra. If the algebra A is noncommutative, then the commutator with respect to an element of the algebra A defines a linear endomorphism of A to itself, which is a derivation over K.  An algebra A equipped with a distinguished derivation d forms a differential algebra, and is itself a significant object of study in areas such as differential Galois theory.","fallback":"wikipedia: Derivation (differential algebra)","service_icon":"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/unfurl_icons/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivation_(differential_algebra)"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"9hOFb","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"I think you are talking about a “derivation”: "},{"type":"link","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivation_(differential_algebra)"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1609286099.296000","parent_user_id":"U8D9768Q6","reactions":[{"name":"cool","users":["U6A936746"],"count":1}]}]
