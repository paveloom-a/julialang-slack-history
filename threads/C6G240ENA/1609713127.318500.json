The first dimension keeps track of the function value and the second dimension has algebra defined that works exactly like dx and the chain rule, so it keeps track of the value of the gradient. However, I’m still having trouble seeing how to implement it in practice. I think the example above might be a bit advanced for me to understand what exactly is going on as I’m still a beginner in Julia. I would really appreciate if you could show me a toy examp...","fallback":"JuliaLang: ForwardDiff and Zygote cannot automatically differentiate (AD) function from C^n to R that uses FFT","thumb_url":"https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business5/uploads/julialang/original/2X/1/12829a7ba92b924d4ce81099cbf99785bee9b405.png","ts":1609628204,"from_url":"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/forwarddiff-and-zygote-cannot-automatically-differentiate-ad-function-from-c-n-to-r-that-uses-fft/52440/16","thumb_width":408,"thumb_height":263,"service_icon":"https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business5/uploads/julialang/optimized/2X/6/6ca888e296f59ca2a599807f7d5edd489e3d1829_2_180x180.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/forwarddiff-and-zygote-cannot-automatically-differentiate-ad-function-from-c-n-to-r-that-uses-fft/52440/16"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"YROQM","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"If anyone has time to reply to "},{"type":"link","url":"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/forwarddiff-and-zygote-cannot-automatically-differentiate-ad-function-from-c-n-to-r-that-uses-fft/52440/16"},{"type":"text","text":" please do since I might not have time for about a week and I think anyone in this channel could help out.
