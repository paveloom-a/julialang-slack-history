I am wondering what is the best practice to record the features set selected by feature selection during model building?\n\nAn alternative that I can think about is maintaining a text file containing a feature set, e.g.\n\n_selected_features.txt_\n```feature1\nfeature3\nfeature9```\nAnd then, the script (that runs the classifier), read that file and slice incoming data only on those features.\n\nIs there any better alternatives rather than maintaining the text file? I can see the issue arises due to manual update of text file when updating the classifier, since the updated version could probably use different set of features.","user":"UUT4VGTE2","ts":"1615944855.000300","team":"T68168MUP","edited":{"user":"UUT4VGTE2","ts":"1615944897.000000"},"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"tP0G","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hi guysm I am building a classifier and saving it as pickle file to put in the production environment.
