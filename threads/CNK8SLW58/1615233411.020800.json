To be able to study the longer term behavior of the atmosphere, climate scientists run longer simulations kind of forcing the model to behave close to the observational data in dates that already passed. I think that for your use-case where you were looking for data of one or two stations in the last few months, looking directly at observations is a reasonable option, and looking for a reanalysis is probably overkill. You would have tons of data from a climate model that approximates well the overall state of the atmosphere, including precipitation, temperature profiles, etc etc. For London I assume there are good observational data from the surface.","user":"UEGRU91B2","ts":"1615239147.021300","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"LE7hc","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Yeah, so for example the meteorology agencies run their models initialized with data from observations, but those simulations are not good for many days ahead.
