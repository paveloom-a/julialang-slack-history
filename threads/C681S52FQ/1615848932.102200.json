An EA uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as reproduction, mutation, recombination, and selection. Candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions (see also loss function). Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.\nEvolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types of problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying fitness landscape. Techniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modeling of biological evolution are generally limited to explorations of microevolutionary processes and planning models based upon cellular processes. In most real applications of EAs, computational complexity is a prohibiting factor. In fact, this computational complexity is due to fitness function evaluation. Fitness approximation is one of the solutions to overcome this difficulty. However, seemingly simple EA can solve often complex problems; therefore, there may be no direct link between algorithm complexity and problem complexity.","fallback":"wikipedia: Evolutionary algorithm","service_icon":"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/unfurl_icons/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"Ry/C","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Evolutionary/genetic algorithms should be compatible with your requirements.

An example of such a challenge is optimising the performance of plasma fusion experiments. The highly-nonlinear and temporally-varying interaction between the plasma, its environment and external controls presents a considerable complexity in these experiments. A further difficulty arises from the fact that there is no single objective metric that fully captures both plasma quality and equipment constraints. To efficiently optimise the system, we develop the Optometrist Algorithm, a stochastic perturbation method combined with human choice. Analogous to getting an eyeglass prescription, the Optometrist Algorithm confronts a human operator with two alternative experimental settings and associated outcomes. A human operator then chooses which experiment produces subjectively better results. This innovative technique led to the discovery of an unexpected record confinement regime with positive net heating power in a field-reversed configuration plasma, characterised by a &gt;50% reduction in the energy loss rate and concomitant increase in ion temperature and total plasma energy.","fallback":"Scientific Reports: Achievement of Sustained Net Plasma Heating in a Fusion Experiment with the Optometrist Algorithm","thumb_url":"https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-017-06645-7/MediaObjects/41598_2017_6645_Fig1_HTML.jpg","from_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-06645-7","thumb_width":675,"thumb_height":452,"id":1,"original_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-06645-7"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"1myW","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"The most resembling papers I have seen (which may still be quite far from what you're considering) are from the ML literature.\nBoth are about mixing an algorithmic approach with human expert input (which I guess would be the oracle).\n\n"}]},{"type":"rich_text_list","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"One is the [\"optometrist algorithm\"]("},{"type":"link","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-06645-7"},{"type":"text","text":") by a team at Google.
