Basically, I need to fit data with a heavily nonlinear formula, so: the objective is fast to compute, analytical/autodiff derivatives are easily available, but it is known that the objective \"surface\" is very complex with local minima. There are about 10-20 parameters. Is there any go-to method for such cases?","user":"UGTUKUHLN","ts":"1613173835.076800","team":"T68168MUP","edited":{"user":"UGTUKUHLN","ts":"1613173885.000000"},"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"QXh","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hi!
