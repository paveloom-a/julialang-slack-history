[{"type":"message","text":"Assuming i want to minimize a third degree taylor expansion (which is non convex) of an sufficently nice non-linear function.\nI can express the minimization of a multinomial of third degree as the root finding of a second degree multi variate polynomial, with some  conditions to not find maximas/saddle points and maybe some trust region style constraint. \nAre you aware of algorithm that do that and strategely construct roots to jump in to different local minima in order to find the best one?","user":"U9MD78Z9N","ts":"1609636138.367100","team":"T68168MUP","thread_ts":"1609636138.367100","reply_count":2,"reply_users_count":1,"latest_reply":"1609652264.367400","reply_users":["U67G3QRJM"],"subscribed":false},{"client_msg_id":"fb44bf4b-1daa-44db-aa7a-5c0131cf1cc1","type":"message","text":"IntervalRootFinding.jl and HomotopyContinuation.jl will find all the roots.
