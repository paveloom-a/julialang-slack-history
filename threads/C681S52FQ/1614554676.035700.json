I think that SGD and minibatch optimization are used. But if you have data of the size that requires batching and all, then that usually suggests a pretty large or complex model. In such cases, estimating things like transition matrices gets difficult if you have a lot of states. There are a couple of good books that I know about. The Gosavi book Simulation-Based Optimization is pretty good. There is a good connection between optimization of these large models and reinforcement learning--as the video indicates. If you want something more model-based, then \"Conditional Monte Carlo-Gradient Estimation and Optimization Applications\" by Fu may be good.","user":"UDDSTBX19","ts":"1614869974.064500","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"fgDN","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"user","user_id":"UGTUKUHLN"},{"type":"text","text":" Are you talking about fitting parameters to an analytical model.
