I would really appreciate some help with solving constrained nonlinear optimization problems (in particular, collocated optimal control problems). First off, I am aware of `NLOptControl.jl` and, for now, am just focusing on interacting more directly with the NLP solver. [This gist](<https://gist.github.com/avonmoll/a18b1d77e418a0eb98f854d143424a73>) describes the problems I'm having in solving very simple collocated optimal control problems. The biggest issue seems to be that `GalacticOptim`'s solvers aren't respecting the constraints I specify. As for `JuMP`, it seems difficult to express even these simple dynamics. I've had some success with `NLopt`, but it's very brittle (I get `:FORCED_STOP` without any additional info on what the actual error/problem is).","user":"U01N4PQ663W","ts":"1617044160.042900","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"YqZgH","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Dear, "},{"type":"channel","channel_id":"C681S52FQ"},{"type":"text","text":" community.
