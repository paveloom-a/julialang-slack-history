Here are some open questions regarding v1.6.0 (and possibly v1.5.0) from my notes that would be awesome if we could gain some clarity on. 1.) Do the JLLs matter if we have the corresponding `USE_SYSTEM_*` flag enabled? If not, why are the tests always executed then? 2.) Does Julia even support non-OpenBLAS at this point? Related to (1), in that there is now a JLL for it that is tested. 3.) p7zip and MbedTLS look like superfluous dependencies, are they? 4.) There are several file-related test errors, are these because of the build sandbox? Need to check the issue tracker. 5.) The cert test failure should be able to be worked around by setting `export JULIA_SSL_CA_ROOTS_PATH=\"${cacert}/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt\"`, yet it seems like it still fails, why? 6.) `libgmpxx.so.4` is reported missing if you run the test suite post-install and it is not symlinked, why? 7.) Is there a way to build Julia’s LLVM as a separate derivation so that we do not have to build it every bloody time we change a line in the Julia expression itself? This would cut many minutes from each check and hopefully make debugging easier. 8.) Does the v1.0.5 expression in my PR work properly on macOS? I am unable to test it as I do not have a Mac.","user":"U677R5Q5A","ts":"1617594284.078700","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"Gp1","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Okay, realised when cleaning my daughter’s room that a log is not all that helpful and that organising this a community effort is hard with so many moving parts.
