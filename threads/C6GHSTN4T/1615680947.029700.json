It’s especially nice for parallel computing since specifying how to compute often leads to subtle concurrency bugs. However, each user’s each program might have specific requirements for scheduling to obtain decent performance. In particular, it is challenging to create a single scheduler that can manage very imbalanced load, terminatable reduction, resource requirements,...","fallback":"JuliaLang: [ANN] FoldsThreads.jl: A zoo of pluggable thread-based data-parallel execution mechanisms","thumb_url":"https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business5/uploads/julialang/original/3X/d/d/dd61f3c4c4b4fafc9e56a633391c6627bf22393f.png","fields":[{"title":"Reading time","value":"4 mins :clock2:","short":true},{"title":"Likes","value":"52 :heart:","short":true}],"ts":1612487293,"from_url":"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/ann-foldsthreads-jl-a-zoo-of-pluggable-thread-based-data-parallel-execution-mechanisms/54662","thumb_width":518,"thumb_height":245,"service_icon":"https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business5/uploads/julialang/optimized/2X/6/6ca888e296f59ca2a599807f7d5edd489e3d1829_2_180x180.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/ann-foldsthreads-jl-a-zoo-of-pluggable-thread-based-data-parallel-execution-mechanisms/54662"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"MVujt","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"ref "},{"type":"link","url":"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/ann-foldsthreads-jl-a-zoo-of-pluggable-thread-based-data-parallel-execution-mechanisms/54662"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1615680947.029700","parent_user_id":"UC7AF7NSU"}]
