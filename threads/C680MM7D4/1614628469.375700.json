Reproducible builds provide some safeguards against bad actors in the software supply chain. But building software depends on the tools used to construct the binary, including compilers and build-automation tools, many of which depend on pre-existing binaries. Minimizing the reliance on opaque binaries for building our software ecosystem is the goal of the Bootstrappable Builds project.","fallback":"Bootstrappable builds","from_url":"https://lwn.net/Articles/841797/","service_icon":"https://lwn.net/images/favicon.png","service_name":"lwn.net","id":1,"original_url":"https://lwn.net/Articles/841797/"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"PR3","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"This was visited a while ago over at lwn: "},{"type":"link","url":"https://lwn.net/Articles/841797/"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1614628469.375700","parent_user_id":"U019K6Q9N15"}]
