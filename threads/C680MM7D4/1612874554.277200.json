No worries man, when I first entered this human form I didn't get it either.\nOkay so water is a fluid substance at standard ambient conditions. It's composed of 2 hydrogen atoms bonded to 1 oxygen atom with approximately 118* bond angle. Although humans typically refer to water as an impure substance. IE, it typically contains dissociated ionized compounds, such as, sodium chloride, calcium chloride, etc. This is an artifact of the notion that water is quite polar, and a good solvent. Humans themselves are made of approximately 70% water. Its a common fluid for biological life on Earth.\n\nSo running water relates to the notion that water is also an abundant substance on Earth. It fills many land areas, and supports it's own life forms. Due to the gravitational pull of the Earths nearest moon, commonly called \"the moon\", this water moves. Similarly many other phenomena in the earths atmosphere involve water. For example...\n\nSolar radiation imparts enough energy to impart a phase transition on liquid water. as water in the gas phase approaches the upper atmosphere, where it is much cooler, it tends to condense into particulates. Those particulates can nucleate and generate larger and larger droplets - similar to ostwalt ripening. Depending on how cold the ambient air is, this can result in a liquid(rain) or a solid (snow).\n\nThis rain/snow can also cause water to move. Especially down geological forms like mountains, hills or valleys.","user":"UPUBAM63X","ts":"1612904411.285100","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"oyAse","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Oh you don't know what running water is?
