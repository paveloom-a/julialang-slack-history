They are named after Augustus De Morgan, a 19th-century British mathematician. The rules allow the expression of conjunctions and disjunctions purely in terms of each other via negation.\nThe rules can be expressed in English as:\n\nthe negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations\nthe negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negationsor\n\nthe complement of the union of two sets is the same as the intersection of their complements\nthe complement of the intersection of two sets is the same as the union of their complementsor\n\nnot (A or B) = not A and not B\nnot (A and B) = not A or not B.In set theory and Boolean algebra, these are written formally as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      A\n                      ∪\n                      B\n                    \n                    ¯\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  \n                    A\n                    ¯\n                  \n                \n                ∩\n                \n                  \n                    B\n                    ¯\n                  \n                \n                ,\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      A\n                      ∩\n                      B\n                    \n                    ¯\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  \n                    A\n                    ¯\n                  \n                \n                ∪\n                \n                  \n                    B\n                    ¯\n                  \n                \n                ,\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}{\\overline {A\\cup B}}&amp;={\\overline {A}}\\cap {\\overline {B}},\\\\{\\overline {A\\cap B}}&amp;={\\overline {A}}\\cup {\\overline {B}},\\end{aligned}}}\n  where\n\nA and B are sets,\nA is the complement of A,\n∩ is the intersection, and\n∪ is the <http://union.In|union.In> formal language, the rules are written as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        ¬\n        (\n        P\n        ∨\n        Q\n        )\n        \n        ⟺\n        \n        (\n        ¬\n        P\n        )\n        ∧\n        (\n        ¬\n        Q\n        )\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\neg (P\\lor Q)\\iff (\\neg P)\\land (\\neg Q),}\n  and\n\n  \n    \n      \n        ¬\n        (\n        P\n        ∧\n        Q\n        )\n        \n        ⟺\n        \n        (\n        ¬\n        P\n        )\n        ∨\n        (\n        ¬\n        Q\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\neg (P\\land Q)\\iff (\\neg P)\\lor (\\neg Q)}\n  where\n\nP and Q are propositions,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        ¬\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\neg }\n   is the negation logic operator (NOT),\n\n  \n    \n      \n        ∧\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\land }\n   is the conjunction logic operator (AND),\n\n  \n    \n      \n        ∨\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lor }\n   is the disjunction logic operator (OR),\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        ⟺\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\iff }\n   is a metalogical symbol meaning \"can be replaced in a logical proof with\".Applications of the rules include simplification of logical expressions in computer programs and digital circuit designs.
