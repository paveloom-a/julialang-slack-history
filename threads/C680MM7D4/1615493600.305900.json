And anything that isn't owned by a company is viewed with suspicion.\nCorporate support is key, so even if you can get Linux it'll be Red Hat and nothing else. And don't dream of BYOD (which I wouldn't want anyway in my company. Our laptops are so full of crap due to the ton of \"security\" software they require to connect to the intranet they've become sluggish to use, I would never allow a computer I bought with my own money to be mistreated like that). We have a BYOD scheme for mobile phones, but to make it work you have to give the company the right to reset your phone to factory settings and erase every file in its memory without even warning you in advance!","user":"UPSSPPBFV","ts":"1615533747.330700","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"2AVv","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_quote","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"this has me terrified of working in industry..
