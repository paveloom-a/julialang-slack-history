Logical regions organize data independently from the physical layout of that data in memory, and Legion supports a rich set of operations for dynamically and hierarchically partitioning logical regions [27, 28]. The Legion data model is thus ideally suited for programming models such as NumPy which must manipulate collections of multi-dimensional arrays and support creation of arbitrary views onto those arrays at runtime.
