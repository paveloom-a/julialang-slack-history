But there's a big reason for wanting a code to run in less than an hour instead of slightly more than two hours. The reason is because a code's speed interacts with how we go about our day, and this speed can have a nonlinear effect on our productivity. Here's a concrete example. When I was a PhD student, I had a project which was solving ensembles of stochastic partial differential equations which were a model of the zebrafish hindbrain. Each run of this ensemble took about two hours and ten minutes to perform. For a good chunk of time, I needed to keep running these ensembles in order to manually check the output to tweak the model until it started to look realistic. Tweaking the model took only a ...
