I'm an undergrad and I don't know much about academia at all. But I want to share my experiences with these feelings of failure and some of my own treatment and my own experiences progressing through them.\n\nLast year at the beginning of the pandemic in my city, I had to change my plans darastically. I thought I was going to graduate from my undergrad degree. But because of terrible mental health, I had to delay my graduation. When I did this I felt a lot shame and embarassment from it. I saw my friends graduate and \"move on\" with their lives. It bothered me. It made me feel like a failure. I got into a very negative loop and couldn't do things that I wanted to anymore.\n\nI wanted to hide the truth from people. But thankfully overtime that shame died down a bit enough that I felt more ready to open up to friends about my new path in life, delaying my graduation, and my mental health struggles. When I did this, all my friends and everyone I talked to were all supportive and cared for me. They never thought of me as a failure, and that helped a lot with my mental health. It helped quesh those feelings of being a failure.\n\nAround this same period of time when I got into a very negative loop about myself. I couldn't focus properly on what I had to do. So I reached to doctors and mental health professionals. And I'm so so glad I did so. I got medication and some counselling. And I love it. It just feels nice to talk about my feelings and worries and concerns with an \"external\" person. With my counsellor, there's absolutely no judgement. They prompt me with questions to help me explore my own thoughts and emotions and help me with develop different perspectives on life and different techniques to help me in my life. I always feel energized after talking with my counsellor. I truly believe that everyone would have something to gain from talking with a mental health professional. (Thankfully my university offers counselling to undergrads as part of tuition.)\n\nAnd now in this \"new\" path in my life (delaying my graduation), I realized also that I can really make the most of it. I have now used this year and time to try to focus on my health more and develop more skills and gain new experiences. I've been working on my Julia more and got into a really interesting optimization class that I didn't take before.\n\nSo in summary:\n- Talking about my experiences with others helped me not feel like a failure. Many people I opened up to also shared their own mental health struggles.  And honestly in hindsight, I realized I was not a \"failure\" (whatever that means) even though I thought I was. And thankfully everyone in my life that I've talked to has always been so kind and supportive.\n- Mental health professionals can really help! I love talking to my counsellor to help me explore my own emotions and gain new perspectives\n- Going through a \"new\" path in life made me realize that the world is full of different opportunities and that if I keep an eye out, I'll keep finding more opportunities that might be even more enjoyable than the ones I missed.\n\nI hope and wish for you all the best!

I always feel energized after talking with my counsellor. I truly believe that everyone would have something to gain from talking with a mental health professional. (Thankfully my university offers counselling to undergrads as part of tuition.)\n\nAnd now in this \"new\" path in my life (delaying my graduation), I realized also that I can really make the most of it. I have now used this year and time to try to focus on my health more and develop more skills and gain new experiences. I've been working on my Julia more and got into a really interesting optimization class that I didn't take before.\n\nSo in summary:\n- Talking about my experiences with others helped me not feel like a failure. Many people I opened up to also shared their own mental health struggles.  And honestly in hindsight, I realized I was not a \"failure\" (whatever that means) even though I thought I was. And thankfully everyone in my life that I've talked to has always been so kind and supportive.\n- Mental health professionals can really help! I love talking to my counsellor to help me explore my own emotions and gain new perspectives\n- Going through a \"new\" path in life made me realize that the world is full of different opportunities and that if I keep an eye out, I'll keep finding more opportunities that might be even more enjoyable than the ones I missed.\n\nI hope and wish for you all the best!
