Other measures taken may include annulling the nation's constitution, suspending civil courts and having the head of government assume dictatorial powers.\n[As of 2020] since the end of World War II, there have been 583 coup attempts across the globe, of which 288 were successful . . . About 96 percent were led by the military, while most of the others were carried out by civilian elites, said John Chin, research coordinator at the Institute for Politics and Strategy [in the United States]. . .\nChin said the data are less reliable for autogolpes—which do not have an agreed-upon academic definition—but he estimated a separate 148 autogolpe attempts since 1946, of which 110 took place in autocracies and 38 in democracies. In most cases, the leader has attempted to suspend a constitution or discredit judicial or executive branches of government.\n\nOnly five times, Chin said, has a leader targeted an election winner, and in only one case did that happen in a democracy—in 1948, leading to the outbreak of the Costa Rican civil war.","fallback":"wikipedia: Self-coup","service_icon":"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/unfurl_icons/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-coup"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"i8fbl","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Wikipedia is already on it:\n"},{"type":"link","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-coup"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1609965383.441700","parent_user_id":"U9VG1AYSG"},{"client_msg_id":"2a923687-073c-4858-aae5-652f5ac8e7a7","type":"message","text":"I just googled it and ended up on wikipedia as well :slightly_smiling_face:","user":"UB197FRCL","ts":"1609977060.004400","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"MXWu","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"I just googled it and ended up on wikipedia as well "},{"type":"emoji","name":"slightly_smiling_face"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1609965383.441700","parent_user_id":"U9VG1AYSG"},{"client_msg_id":"3b457072-9f15-4030-8351-d5677c45f113","type":"message","text":"I have a preference for autocoup though! :fr:","user":"UB197FRCL","ts":"1609977081.004600","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"hmtD","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"I have a preference for autocoup though!
