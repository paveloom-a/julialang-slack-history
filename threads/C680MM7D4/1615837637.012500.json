I have had several mentors throughout my life who have helped mold me into the person I am today - I am forever indebted to them! In terms of helpfulness, I would say that something that has guided me to mentors is the notion of finding someone who is doing something I am thoroughly interested in but I am _not quite there yet_. Be it in programming or philosophy or mathematics, the way I generally find mentors is to see someone who is doing the thing that I am interested in and figuring out a way to work with them.
