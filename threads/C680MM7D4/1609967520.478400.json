As the civil rights movement and dismantling of Jim Crow laws in the 1950s and 1960s visibly deepened existing racial tensions in much of the Southern United States, Republican politicians such as presidential candidate Richard Nixon and Senator Barry Goldwater developed strategies that successfully contributed to the political realignment of many white, conservative voters in the South who had traditionally supported the Democratic Party rather than the Republican Party. It also helped to push the Republican Party much more to the right.The \"Southern Strategy\" refers primarily to \"top down\" narratives of the political realignment of the South which suggest that Republican leaders consciously appealed to many white Southerners' racial grievances in order to gain their support. This top-down narrative of the Southern Strategy is generally believed to be the primary force that transformed Southern politics following the civil rights era. This view has increasingly been disputed by historians such as Matthew Lassiter, Kevin M. Kruse and Joseph Crespino, who have presented an alternative, \"bottom up\" narrative, which Lassiter has called the \"suburban strategy\". This narrative recognizes the centrality of racial backlash to the political realignment of the South, but suggests that this backlash took the form of a defense of de facto segregation in the suburbs rather than overt resistance to racial integration and that the story of this backlash is a national rather than a strictly Southern one.The perception that the Republican Party had served as the \"vehicle of white supremacy in the South\", particularly during the Goldwater campaign and the presidential elections of 1968 and 1972, made it difficult for the Republican Party to win back the support of black voters in the South in later years. In 2005, Republican National Committee chairman Ken Mehlman formally apologized to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) for exploiting racial polarization to win elections and ignoring the black vote.","fallback":"wikipedia: Southern strategy","service_icon":"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/unfurl_icons/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"iis7","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"link","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1609967520.478400","parent_user_id":"U011V2YN59N"},{"client_msg_id":"23b38efc-8f7c-42c8-ba30-b9de8673b44a","type":"message","text":"Ok fair enough, you have cititations.","user":"U6A936746","ts":"1609967641.479900","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"ABi=","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Ok fair enough, you have cititations."}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1609967520.478400","parent_user_id":"U011V2YN59N","reactions":[{"name":"joy","users":["UCLGS1HML","U6CJRSR63","UGU761DU2","UH8A351DJ","U73KENNG4","U6QGE7S86"],"count":6}]},{"client_msg_id":"a2b4cc49-889c-42e0-afba-fed8f28461ad","type":"message","text":"If you wanna hear Lee Atwater say it in an interview, here you go. \n\n<https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X_8E3ENrKrQ|https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X_8E3ENrKrQ>","user":"U6QGE7S86","ts":"1609971468.497000","team":"T68168MUP","attachments":[{"service_name":"YouTube","service_url":"https://www.youtube.com/","title":"Exclusive: Lee Atwater's Infamous 1981 Interview on the Southern Strategy","title_link":"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X_8E3ENrKrQ","author_name":"The Nation","author_link":"https://www.youtube.com/c/thenation","thumb_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X_8E3ENrKrQ/hqdefault.jpg","thumb_width":480,"thumb_height":360,"fallback":"YouTube Video: Exclusive: Lee Atwater's Infamous 1981 Interview on the Southern Strategy","video_html":"<iframe width=\"400\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X_8E3ENrKrQ?feature=oembed&autoplay=1&iv_load_policy=3\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","video_html_width":400,"video_html_height":225,"from_url":"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X_8E3ENrKrQ","service_icon":"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/unfurl_icons/youtube.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X_8E3ENrKrQ"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"S76vZ","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"If you wanna hear Lee Atwater say it in an interview, here you go. \n\n"},{"type":"link","url":"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X_8E3ENrKrQ","text":"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X_8E3ENrKrQ"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1609967520.478400","parent_user_id":"U011V2YN59N","reactions":[{"name":"+1","users":["U011V2YN59N"],"count":1}]}]
