It hasn't, and our previous two blog posts on MongoDB's license change and Copyleft Equality are still relevant. The only statement we'd like to add is:To our knowledge, there is no individual nor organization who has yet agreed that they will run a project under the SS Public License and be themselves bound by the SS Public License. That license remains a disingenuous proposal until it's put to use in an “inbound=outbound” licensing configuration.","fallback":"Software Freedom Conservancy: On Elastic, its fork, MongoDB, and the SS Public License","thumb_url":"https://sfconservancy.org/img/conservancy-logo.png","from_url":"https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2021/jan/29/elastic-and-ss-public-license/","thumb_width":597,"thumb_height":529,"service_icon":"https://sfconservancy.org/favicon.ico","id":1,"original_url":"https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2021/jan/29/elastic-and-ss-public-license/"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"8/DwS","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"link","url":"https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2021/jan/29/elastic-and-ss-public-license/"}]}]}],"thread_ts":"1611971157.353000","reply_count":1,"reply_users_count":1,"latest_reply":"1611973501.353200","reply_users":["U0179G7FG4F"],"subscribed":false},{"client_msg_id":"324d302b-ed96-48dd-88ac-b2cf11c4f00a","type":"message","text":"This is really interesting.
