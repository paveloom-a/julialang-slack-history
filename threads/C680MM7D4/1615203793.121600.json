So, there may be some underlying traumas which results in some pronounced vulnerability when it comes to discussion with a community which is mainly driven by western and privileged people (viewed from their point of view). Of course, speculation, but I say that, because I am thinking about the previous discussions we had about inclusiveness and being open as a community, and how difficult those discussions have been, and I already mentioned the one which has banned, who acted similar. As we are mainly focusing on technical aspects and questions, it is quite a challenge to be simultaneously sensitive and open, if the counterpart perhaps brings a load of invisible self-experienced insults (I mean mental wounds here), which can be triggered so easily. Of course, we can't solve this issue, and who is \"we\" in this thoughts. For me I can tell, that I can't solve it for myself, as I will sometimes fall again into this trap, without wanting to, but than it's too late, the counterpart is offended and thinking back, the signs have been there but I missed them. We already have some experience with these discussions, which go wrong. <@U6740K1SP> felt the direction and slowed the discussion down, which again offended OP. So, the sensors seem already in place, but how to act on these sensors? Perhaps we need a really moderated space, where every post has to be approved, before it goes online. Approving the posts would be to check against hidden accusations, hidden personal afronts and alike, which may trigger the wrong direction. This would be work, and should not only be done by stewards, perhaps another new gremium to approve posts in this moderated space. When sensors giving alarm, the discussion could be paused, OP could be asked if it is ok to be moved into moderated space/mode. If no, give it a chance, until sensors ring again. Second time is a forced moderated mode. It must be made clear that moderation mode is not a offence against the OP but a countermeasure against offences. Would such a system be recognised as a way to be open in difficult situations or would it be seen as another way to shutting people down? Well, these are the edge cases of an open community.
