Many conspiracy theories relate to clandestine government plans and elaborate murder plots. Conspiracy theories usually deny consensus or cannot be proven using the historical or scientific method and are not to be confused with research concerning verified conspiracies such as Germany's pretense for invading Poland in World War II.\nIn principle, conspiracy theories are not always false by default and their validity depends on evidence just as in any theory. However, they are often discredited a priori due to the cumbersome and improbable nature of many of them.\nPsychologists attribute finding a conspiracy where there is none to a form of cognitive bias called illusory pattern perception.","fallback":"wikipedia: List of conspiracy theories","service_icon":"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/unfurl_icons/wikipedia.png","id":1,"original_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conspiracy_theories"}],"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"sZsK","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"I help!
