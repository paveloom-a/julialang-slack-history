Made a new package for nonlocal sensitivity analysis, which extends this algorithm. A full user guide, with motivation, examples and jupyter notebooks is here: <https://dhruva2.github.io/MinimallyDisruptiveCurves.docs/> What does it do? You’ve already fitted some model, by minimising a cost function on the model behaviour. Any type of model, as long as the cost function is differentiable.
