I was trying to make a custom distribution for Turing to help avoid loops, and to make certain common operations easier. I have to define a bijector for the distribution.

The dimensionality of the transformation? Something else?","user":"UGFD16K6D","ts":"1615986916.014600","team":"T68168MUP","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"ZPf","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Hi.
