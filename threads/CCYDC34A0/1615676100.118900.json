This is a multivariate distribution after all so you need to look at the probability of both variables simultaneously. If you analyse the effect of `p1`, you see that `p2` can only be 0.6 if `p1 &lt; 0.6` which has a probability of `0.3`. `P(p2 = 0.6 | p1)` is itself a function of `p1` because of the normalisation constant. Perhaps, the semantics you are going for are not compatible with a truncated normal distribution for `p2` with stochastic support. Maybe you want to have the mean of `p2` offset from `p1` by a constant to maintain a constant shape in the truncated distribution? Or you may not even want normal distribution but exponential.","user":"U85JBUGGP","ts":"1615676100.118900","team":"T68168MUP","edited":{"user":"U85JBUGGP","ts":"1615676177.000000"},"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"TjW9","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Note that the prior probability of "},{"type":"text","text":"p2 = 0.6","style":{"code":true}},{"type":"text","text":" is not as high as you may think it is.
